<h3>Memento (ME)mori(al)</h3>

<p>While the myth of Walt’s cryogenically frozen body is certainly compelling,
it is also undeniably untrue. Baudrillard’s mythologizing of Disney enacts the
same kind of covering up that critics of the Disney Company so often hinge their
critiques on. In reality, Walt was cremated two days after his death, as a
result of complications from lung cancer (Gabler 626). Walt was a heavy smoker
for much of his life, and it led to his death in 1966 at the age of 65.</p>

<p>Rearticulating the Disney-World-as-monument through the Death Tour,
necessitates consideration of the ways The Walt Disney Company itself
articulates death throughout its parks. Most notable is the case of Walt
himself, whose many portraits and various other photographs throughout the park
have had the cigarettes carefully airbrushed from them, often leaving two
fingers delicately pointing towards nothing, or awkwardly extended in front of
him; some of these images still contain a faint smoke from the missing
cigarette, a secondhand reminder of what killed Walt (Cade). Tom Hanks even
mimicked the artificial two-finger point in his portrayal of Walt in the 2013
film <em>Saving Mr. Banks</em>, yet another depiction void of smoking but not of
smoke (Buerger). We are not interrogating the ethics of a revisionist approach
to Walt’s image here, but would like to emphasize that this seems endemic of a
deep cultural unease with death enacted throughout these parks.</p>

<p>That being said, there is one location at Walt Disney World that does portray
death—the Haunted Mansion, the Orlando version of which opened in 1971. No
deaths have been reported on the ride, but that has not negated its mythic
depth. One ride operator interviewed explains that the ride shuts down several
times a year to clean up ashes spread by park guests, presumably of loved ones
who held a meaningful connection to the ride. When inquiring if the ashes are
collected and stored somewhere, we were told that the process instead involves
brooms and vacuums. While this is a rumor in the strictest sense, it would
indicate that the playful irreverence of the attraction might bleed into the
logic of yet another of Disney’s death procedures. Highlight this example
suggests that a playful logic at Disney can have stark consequences, and that a
subtle shift in this logic through the inventive structures of electracy can
hold meaningful sway in constructing a spirited, inclusive image of death in
collective mourning.</p>

<p>And perhaps this used to be the case. Memento Mori, the gift shop supplement
of the Haunted Mansion, once sold customizable death certificates, playful
compositions that juxtaposed the living with the dead. While these are no longer
purchasable, the shop now offers “Spirit Photographs,” personalized 8x10”
holographic portraits that, upon tilting, morph one’s face into that of a
ghoul’s. And even today the ghouls and phantoms darting around within the walls
of the Haunted Mansion engage in some of the only implementation of augmented
reality within the park, as if Disney itself were instrumentalizing  the
technology as one of communing with the dead. Their mixed reality dancing indeed
inspired our own haunting of the park, our own Spirit Photography MEmorial that
works within the preexisting electrate logics of Walt Disney World.</p>

<h3>Monumental Mice</h3>

<p>It goes without saying that Mickey Mouse serves as more than just the
official mascot of The Walt Disney Company, but also one of the most famous
cartoon characters in the world. However the iconic mouse was originally named
Mortimer, a name often associated with death and the grim reaper, with clear
etymological traces to Middle English and Latin (<em>mors</em> and
<em>mort</em>-, death). At the behest of Walt’s wife Lillian, the name was
changed to Mickey, on the basis of the name Mortimer being too pretentious. But
Mortimer did eventually become a character in the Disney Universe, making his
first appearance as the villain “Mr. Slicker” in the 1930 comic strip “Mr.
Slicker and the Egg Robbers,” and his first appearance with the name Mortimer
Mouse six years later in the animated short “Mickey’s Rival,” where he firmly
cements his place in Disney’s history as Mickey’s primary antagonist.</p>

<p>A psychoanalytic or hermeneutic interpretation of this might view Mortimer
Mouse as a repressed death drive or id. Suppressing the mouse’s true Mortimer
nature by naming him Mickey, causes a villain bearing the name to surface. Of
course, the Death Tour considers Mortimer in a difference
sense—instrumentalizing him as a mascot for death within the borders of Disney
World. Although most other villains have their own mascots within the park,
there has never been a live Mortimer.</p>

<p>Implementing the Mortimer mascot to rewrite the images of hidden deaths
throughout the park, riffs off of Disney’s “Hidden Mickeys,” the concealed
insertions of the iconic tri-circle Mickey head throughout Disney parks. Just as
Hidden Mickeys started as an in-joke between early Disney Imagineers and has
become a favorite means of secretly participating in the parks’ community
(Roseboom), the Death Tour MEmorial began as a shared, hidden means of rewriting
the park, one offered up to the larger community. Just as Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle’s Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to investigate the death of his friend
in <em>The Hound of the Baskervilles</em>, so too do these Mortimers call for a
closer examination, a second look at what it means to be a visitor of the parks.
This memento mori is not a morbid or repressed action, but rather an attempt at
an electrate reflection on death.</p>
