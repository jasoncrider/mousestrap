<p>Disney Death Tour identifies structural death at Disney theme parks,
reminding tourists of their own mortality. However, as Ulmer writes, the
MEmorial is “not intended to condemn or pass judgment, but instead visualize the
invisible sacrifices made on behalf of certain cultural or national values
(xiii).” The MEmorial in general, and Disney Death Tour specifically, are meant
to provoke, but not to insult. In terms of ambient tourism, the goal is not to
shame, but to engage with ambience so “as to (at least potentially) reattune or
otherwise transform how others inhabit the world to an extent that calls for
some action” (Rickert 162). As a counter-narrative to Disney’s highly-mediated
spaces and muted depictions of death, the Death Tour provides a means of
rumination on some of the invisible consequences of modern commercial tourism
and entertainment. Within composition studies, this MEmorial explores the
possibilities of electrate writing practices distinct from literate
memorialization. The alternative mapping capabilities enabled through its AR
counterpart further allow us to reintroduce death as a central but underexamined
part of the rhetorical process. And while other MEmorials identify various
deaths supporting abject communal values, often drawing upon “haunting” as a
metaphor for MEmorial and AR’s revelatory function, death’s theoretical
significance is left underexamined. The aim is therefore not to ameliorate theme
park fatalities—OSHA exists for that—but to enter what this project terms “Death
Rhetoric” into widely-shared community considerations of space.</p>

<p>The Death Tour confronts a tragic and sensitive subject, with the ethical
considerations informing a methodology—how to avoid appropriating the dead,
insulting the living, or merely exposing the skeletons in Disney’s closet. Of
course, the dead cannot speak for themselves, and neither would we presume to
write for them. Therefore this critical tour argues for a new ethics of mapping
death, one that confronts ethical reservations through theories of writing
informed by the limitations set by existence. As a writing, the Death Tour
responds to appeals from Scot Barnett and Diane Davis to conceive of rhetoric
and composition in ways that resist containerized representation. Though this
map gives a limited depiction of those who physically died at Disney, and where
those deaths occurred, indicating their hidden presence does take a step towards
articulating the dead in a larger network of distributed identity, what Ulmer
identifies as “avatar.”</p>

<p>Barnett’s “Psychogeographies of Writing” challenges compositionists to
acknowledge and work creatively within the “limits of representation” in order
to develop new maps of writing (and in turn write new maps). For Barnett, citing
Judith Butler, writing commits violence when representations expect certainty
from their subjects, or in other words, representation seeks essences. On this
map one finds indications of physical death, those who used-to-be-in-the-world.
The challenge is to avoid doubling down on “ethical violence.” Barnett
argues,</p>


<p><blockquote>an act of ethical violence occurs
when we ask of the other the question ‘who are you?’ and demand in return a
satisfactory response capable of presenting a clear and coherent image of the
other’s self. Though often couched in the name of ethics, such acts, Butler has
argued, nevertheless demand of the other something she cannot possibly
provide—namely, an account of the self that is self-identical with the ‘I’ in
whose name she speaks. (“Psychogeographies”)</blockquote></p>

<p>Articulating death merely exacerbates writing’s failure to represent what not
even the living other can present as a coherent self.</p>

<p>In one sense, this alternative mapping of Walt Disney World turns a
smartphone into a can of spray-paint, inscribing a corporate space with
unsanctioned writings. Barnett, however, problematizes these rebellious
assumptions, arguing that “although attempting to unmask and demystify hidden
power relations can satisfy in the short term, doing so also has the potential
to leave in place the very thing we hoped to transcend—in this case the problem
of yet another representation of space quietly asserting its own truth or
authenticity.” Yes, Disney Death Tour attempts to demystify hidden power
relations at work in Disney World, but rather than insisting on one
interpretation of Disney (a reading), a focus on the writing-tourist shifts
attention to what Barnett describes as “those irreducible aspects of embodied
being-in-the-world that haunt the accounts we offer of ourselves but that may
never find a comfortable place in the discourses we rely upon to represent and
memorialize those accounts” (“Psychogeographies”). Critical tourism is the
participation in a contest for writing spaces through travel, and involves the
embodied experience of being-in-the-world. In light of Barnett’s admonishments,
composition scholars must be careful not to replace one totalizing narrative
with another, and instead acknowledge the limits of critiques contingent upon
the limits of representation.</p>

<p>Representation’s inadequacy to account for the irreducible aspects of
being-in-the-world challenges the field to work against the “discourses we rely
upon to represent and memorialize those accounts.” This project treats
skeptically the notion of simply preserving and retrieving the memory of the
dead through writing and mostly avoids those questions altogether. We can
acknowledge the limitations of writing as representation, but how do we “see
without knowing,” as Barnett calls for? How do we leave “open and unresolved the
impasse between memory and the immemorial?” How in this project are we to find
“a language that continuously interrupts the will to craft a narrative out of
memory” (“Psychogeographies”)? Barnett issues a challenge to which composition
must develop theoretical responses to ethical concerns.</p>

<p>The limits of literate representation mark the space for inventing electrate
writing practices like MEmorial. Another prominent inquiry into death
exemplifies literacy and eletracy's divergent concerns. Over 12 episodes of the
journalism podcast Serial, Sarah Koenig thoroughly examines the 1999 murder of
high school student Hae Min Lee (footnote). Adnan Syed, the man imprisoned for
the crime, insists on his innocence. Koenig weighs his claim against archival
records, witness testimonies, and expert opinions. Episode one begins with a
memory exercise: try to remember in detail what you were doing six weeks ago. If
the task proves difficult to answer with certainty, and as Koenig’s experiment
reveals, accounts are often revised or conflicting, consider that 1999 was 18
years ago at the time of this writing. Serial is a master work of investigative
journalism, but it also demonstrates the limits of written memorialization. The
season finale leaves personal and legal judgments about Adnan Syed unresolved
and perhaps unresolvable.</p>

<p>Journalistic objectivity tends toward containerization, the demand to know
for the record. When a figure like Syed resists tidy representations, and when a
journalistic account reaches its disciplinary limits, the result can be
frustrating. As one commenter exclaims in episode eight, “Well then who the fuck
did it?” In its expletive-inducing journalistic restraint, Serial reaches the
very limits of literate remembrance practices. Koenig ends with a big “I don’t
know,” not for certain anyway. Her exhaustive diligence not to reduce the
complexities of lived experience to a snappy story resembles a Butlerian
journalistic ethic. Working as an extension beyond the containerization of
literate journalism, the MEmorial then “begins with a sting (punctum) received
from a news item, a story from the daily dose of information circulated by
journalism” (Ulmer xx). Electrate writing practices do not displace but extend
literate journalism. In response to Barnett, MEmorials seek not better
containers, but alternative approaches.</p>

<h3>Thinking without Knowing</h3>

<p>As discussed in the Thanatourism section, emplacement forwards an ethics
attuned to the material specifics of place, engaged locally, in detail, rather
than in abstract tropes. In this sense, emplacement resembles a journalistic
project. To avoid containing the irreducible complexities of lived experience to
the obituary section of the newspaper, it becomes essential to work past
journalism as memorialization and into the theoretical possibilities of
MEmorialization as an electrate writing practice for civic engagement. Though it
may be impossible to substitute writing for the memory of lived experience, the
Death Tour opens a consideration of death’s rhetoricity.</p>

<p>In her introduction to <em>Inessential Solidarity</em>, Diane Davis argues
that what Butler and Barnett treat as concerns to be avoided are in reality
impossible altogether: “There is no longer any way to pose [ontology’s] defining
question, a question of uncontaminated essence: ‘What is X?’ There is no
immanent or intrinsic being, no essence in itself that would therefore be
capable of presenting itself as such” (4). Davis shifts the stakes from
taxonomical to rhetorical and theoretical. Drawing extensively from Jean-Luc
Nancy, she identifies a “preoriginary rhetoricty” in the condition of
distributed being. According to Nancy, being is always already contaminated by
community and environs; the “singularity” of the individual “designate[s]
precisely that which, each time, forms a point of exposure, traces an
intersection of limits on which there is exposure. To be exposed is to be on the
limit where, at the same time, there is both inside and outside, and neither
inside nor outside.” This exposure, Davis says, “[Precedes] symbolic
identification … is relationality as such; it is constitutive of being, which is
always and only in the mode of exposition and not essence” (7). Barnett’s
project seeks pre-reflective aspects of being-in-the-world. Davis finds in the
world a being-with that is always a being-for, a “solidarity that precedes
symbolicity” (15).</p>

<p>“A Rhetoric of Responsibility” makes it clear that the role of dying at
Disney extends beyond mere morbid fascination. Nancy writes, “what community
reveals to me, in presenting to me my birth and my death, is my existence
outside myself” (10). As Davis puts it, “Death marks the absolute limit of
identification and (so) of understanding … ‘my’ finitude…can communicate itself
to me only through ‘your’ mortality.” Disney Death Tour puts Walt Disney World
visitors face-to-face with death. Nancy’s concept “face” does not refer to nose
and cheeks and skin, nor death’s skeletal personification, but what Davis calls
“the site of ‘my’ encounter with the inassimilable alterity of the other, which
provokes an interruption in identification and cognition” (12). She continues,
“What one encounters in the face to face is the other’s finitude, the other’s
exposedness—that is to say, both his or her mortality…” By pinpointing Disney
deaths down to latitude and longitude, the Death Tour literalizes the processes
of exposure in order to visualize sites of encounter.</p>

<p>However, Death Rhetoric is not a means of reducing the complexities of
rhetorical being to simple map markers, but of articulating a reminder that, as
Davis argues, “Responsibility kicks in as a response to finitude’s deadly
intensity” (11). Barnett tasks composition with finding ways of “seeing without
knowing.” Davis replies, “Thinking is not the same as knowing, and the challenge
today, the social, ethical, and political challenge is to learn to think the
sharing of community without effacing precisely this sharing by conceptualizing
it, turning it into an object to be grasped and put to work” (8). Death
depictions like the Haunted Mansion offer a containerized version of death
without consequences. They are not sites of encountering one’s own mortality,
and are certainly not intended to be. In response to Disney’s glossy
performances of death, the Death Tour inscribes Walt Disney World with “Hidden
Mortimers,” a play on the “Hidden Mickeys” scattered throughout Disney parks.
Whereas headstones mark a literate exercise in representation, perhaps these map
markers should be thought of as facestones, electrate renderings of death’s
finitude. This tour challenges indifference, “the luxury of exposed existents
who are not faced with the fact of their exposedness.” At these sites of
encounter, “The face comes through each time as pure appeal, persuasion without
a rhetorician” (14). Ultimately, the Death Tour indicates not just death, but
being’s underlying solidarity—being-for—realized when “communal life holds
itself ‘at a level equal to death’” (10).</p>

<p>Obviously this formulation of space applies everywhere, not just Disney
World. But if we accept Davis’s preoriginary rhetoricity, and death as the
standard to which everyday life should be held, then what’s needed is not better
representations of death in space, but more useful reminders. Furthermore,
inventing electrate writing practices often means the playful coining of
neologisms and repurposing of old terms through puns. In our case, death’s
rhetorical appeal means revising the term “theme park” to suggest inertia,
pause, and recognition.</p>
