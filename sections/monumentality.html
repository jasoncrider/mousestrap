<p>As a MEmorial, Disney Death Tour theorizes how we might write and rethink our
relationship to tourism and entertainment by memorializing those who have lost
their lives at Disney’s various theme parks. By enacting our MEmorial through an
augmented reality application, the parks themselves can be rewritten as sites of
mourning and memorial, generating what Ulmer calls the “inhabitable monument,” a
civic practice for an everted network (117). The emphasis on “me” in “MEmorial”
opens an investigation as to how we relate to the larger structure, in this case
Disney’s theme parks, and forces us to confront a shared experience of tragedy,
or in Virilio’s terms, the integral accident built into the park’s
infrastructure. While a traditional memorial might generalize these losses, the
MEmorial “[takes] up the paradox of group subjectivity in electracy” (118), and
experiments with placing the losses of a community in direct relation with
ourselves. As Sean Morey writes, a MEmorial allows individuals to not only
witness, but author their experience of a place in order to manifest individual
and collective mourning. In Morey’s Roadkill Tollbooth MEmorial, digital
monuments are dispersed along the Gulf Coast and down Highway One, marking sites
of significance from the Deepwater Horizon disaster, where “the traveler must
experience the total distance of a distributed memorial, picking up information
and clues from each stop that help understand the next” (“Roadkill Tollbooth”).
Like Morey’s Tollbooth MEmorial, our monuments are distributed throughout the
space they critically index, opening up new avenues for visitors to engage with
the park.</p>

<p>As travelers to Disney World in Orlando, we have chosen to confront the
losses of life that have been made invisible as we author our relations to the
park, Orlando, and Florida at large. Being citizens of Florida, especially so
close to Orlando, means we exist in an economy emboldened by the tourist and
entertainment industries. And being visitors to Disney’s parks means operating
within a community that does not actively acknowledge the deaths that occur as a
result of its existence. As we move throughout the park, we confront a
meticulously cultivated narrative with the taboo of death; by reconfiguring
ourselves within the networks of these communities, we negotiate values that are
not otherwise being acknowledged.</p>

<p>It is important to acknowledge that Walt Disney World in Orlando was
constructed as a monument to Walt Disney, and so in some sense the park’s
existence is always already about death. But within this monument there are
ongoing deaths that are not recognized, causing dissonance within the community.
As an electronic monument, Disney Death Tour theorizes how we might negotiate
this monument to account for these losses. As Ulmer states, “A first step in the
design of a MEmorial is to notice an abject loss that the community acknowledges
is a problem but that is not accepted as a sacrifice on behalf of a belief or
value structuring a group subject” (134). Rather than critiquing Disney’s
narrative as others have done, we instead offer this monument as an electrate
means of civic engagement, of shifting the park-as-monument to reflect a
forgotten community value.</p>

<p>Previous MEmorial projects have offered us a precedent on how we might
theorize our monument. Sean Morey’s “Deepwater Horizon MEmorial Roadkill
Tollbooth” “proposes an electrate alternative to memorializing the disaster of
the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010,” and works to theorize “how we might
write our relationship to nature differently through digital writing and digital
media,” and advocate for public policy change relating to the disaster. Madison
Jones and Jacob Greene’s “Augmented Vélorutionaries: Digital Rhetoric,
Memorials, and Public Discourse” employs a MEmorial through an augmented reality
mobile phone application that replaces removed ghost bikes, memorials emplaced
by a community to mourn cyclists killed by motor vehicles. And while not an
explicit MEmorial, Melissa Bianchi and Jacob Greene’s “SeeWorld: Visualizing
Animal Captivity Practices at SeaWorld Orlando” uses augmented reality to
provide a counternarrative that exposes the unethical treatment of animals at
SeaWorld.</p>

<p>These projects not only help situate the Disney Death Tour as what Madison
Jones describes as “emplaced composition,” (2017), but also as a digital writing
practice that forces us to be writers of the park rather than readers. As stated
earlier, the Disney Death Tour does not aim to critique Disney like countless
others have, but rather to construct  an image of the park that includes
ourselves, as well as otherwise forgotten members of its community. By writing
our image through multimodal writing technologies, we are engaging in what Jody
Shipka calls “new mediational means,” where we consider how new tools of
mediation alter not only the activities we engage in, but also how they
remediate our relationship to our bodies and surroundings (<em>Toward a
Composition Made Whole</em>, 48-50). When we configure the MEmorial as a
multimodal and emplaced writing practice, we begin to see composition, in
Shipka’s terms, as the result of an endlessly interconnected chain of events and
contexts, which then leads us to look at what contexts and histories are being
privileged (50-53). In the case of our tourism, it is not enough to simply
analyze our experience in a traditional sense, so we instead turn to an
electrate frame of reference for negotiating our image within the realities of
not only Disney, but also within the operations of the surrounding entertainment
culture at large.</p>

<p>In writing our electronic monument, we must reconcile the fact that we might
not like the image we see as we resituate ourselves within electracy. Morey
narrates this sentiment in the denouement of “Roadkill Tollbooth”:</p>

<p><blockquote>The practice of writing this MEmorial, even in the virtual,
relates to me how I relate to the disaster in the gulf, and how the disaster in
me relates to its cause, and those abject sacrifices which must pay the toll.
Now I must decide, as Ulmer states, if that image is me. If I recognize it, but
don’t like it, then I must produce my own change for the sake of all my
relations.</blockquote></p>

<p>By moving from a reading of the park to a writing of, from hermeneutics to
invention, we allow for what Ulmer describes as follows: “I catch sight of my
superego by appropriating an event that I recognize as somehow expressive of a
feeling. In this scene I recognize not so much my own history as the nature of
existence as I believe it to be (a metaphysical intuition).” Or in other words,
“I do not explain the problem; it explains me” (<em>Electronic Monuments</em>,
138).</p>
