\
<p>William Gibson’s 2007 novel Spook Country features an avant-garde \
augmented reality artist, Alberto Corrales, who creates “invisible \
virtual monuments” to dead celebrities as art installations throughout \
Hollywood (49). Corrales’ first installation features the reenacted \
death of River Phoenix outside of the Viper Lounge, Johnny Depp’s \
nightclub in West Hollywood. Like all of Corrales’ installations, the \
scene of the death is viewed through an AR-capable headset at the very \
site of its occurrence, and thus exists as a mixed reality, \
location-based composition. If everyone had these headsets, envisions \
Corrales, “the world we walk around in would be channels” (46). Of \
course, with the ubiquity of the smartphone, everyone now does walk \
around with these headsets in a way, and these channels are increasingly \
being realized. This is one of many ways Gibson explores the rise of \
ubicomp, AR, and locative media throughout the novel as a means of \
modernizing the “cyberspace” metaphor he first coined in “Burning \
Chrome” and popularized in Neuromancer. Gibson’s updated metaphor is \
“eversion,” the idea that the network is no longer imagined as an \
ethereal substratum existing in a second order to humans, but is rather \
a physical artifact with tangible relations and consequences.</p> \
\
<p>The eversion metaphor echos Steven Jones’ declaration in regards to \
digital humanities scholarship of augmented reality’s primacy as our \
contemporary metaphor for digital spaces. Jones writes: “the augmented \
has displaced the virtual, and computing has gone mobile and locative” \
and that AR or mixed reality’s collapsing of digital and physical spaces \
forces us to construct new practices and questions that “address the \
social, locative, embodied, and object-oriented nature of our experience \
in the networked world” (14). To this end, the Hidden Mortimers MEmorial \
serves to enact an everted critique at the site of Disney’s Magic \
Kingdom, an embodied and site-specific mixed reality intervention that \
invites park visitors to negotiate the narratives and dimensionalities \
they experience throughout the park.</p> \
\
<p>The reasoning behind our use of augmented reality as the specific medium \
for constructing the Hidden Mortimers MEmorial is twofold. The first is \
simple pragmatism--the AR apparatus provides a means of interfacing with \
an everted network, one of Corrales’ “channels,” in a mobile, \
streamlined manner. In this sense it follows Andries van Dam’s claim \
that “the best interface is no interface—‘I think, therefore the \
computer gives me what I thought about (and what I should think about)’” \
(64). In other words, the AR underpinnings enable a clean electrate \
app/aratus that is both immediate and unburdensome, a pocket-sized \
countermonument that operates without the cumbersome headset imagined in \
Gibson’s novel. Second, AR as a medium holds deeper significance for the \
ways in which this project is rendered. In this sense, we are taking up \
Lev Manovich’s call in “The poetics of augmented space” to \
“reconceptualize augmentation as an idea and cultural and aesthetic \
practice rather than as a technology” (220). Marshall McLuhan’s famous \
quip throughout Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man, “the medium \
is the message,” certainly holds sway here, but perhaps more aptly, we \
take up Neil Postman’s claim that the medium is instead the metaphor. \
The AR metaphor we are attempting to enact here is not one as \
distasteful as communing with spirits or disturbing a haunted space, but \
instead one that implements AR as a poetics for interfacing with \
erasure. As Jacob Greene and Madison Jones argue in “Augmented \
Vélorutionaries,” “location-based AR criticism operates rhetorically not \
to overwhelm the user with information, statistics, and research but \
rather to open up affective avenues through which alternative public \
discourses about a location might emerge.” In other words, we are not \
interested in communing with the “spooks” from Gibson’s Spook Country \
(which he defines as both “specter, ghost, revenant” and “slang for \
‘intelligence agent’”) but rather in how an augmented medium both \
theorizes and catalyzes a negotiable public discourse through \
approaching its design and implementation as, in Manovich’s words, “an \
architectural problem.” By creating digital memorials at fixed locations \
within the park, this AR application invites park visitors to ritualize \
and reflect on the augmentations with which they choose to interface.</p> \
\
<p>Nathan Jurgenson puts this similarly in “Always Already Augmented,” a \
reflection on the location-based AR game Pokémon Go:</p> \
\
<blockquote>[I]t is misleading to oppose the real to the augmented. Wandering \
through town we encounter a deeply augmented reality even if we are not \
playing Pokemon Go, not carrying a screen with us. From billboards \
overhead to the sounds of music from passing cars to the architecture of \
surrounding buildings to the city planning it all rests on, reality is \
augmented everywhere at every moment. And that’s not even considering \
the deeper augmentations of cultural norms, or the structures of \
language itself. Language is built on “augmenting” what is “here and \
now” with a record of ideas and people and actions that transcend time \
and space and presence.</blockquote> \
\
<p>For Jurgenson, “reality” is only distinguishable from “augmented \
reality,” in that its augmentations have been naturalized and thus \
operate invisibly. What Pokémon Go offers is a disruption of this \
naturalization, one that makes certain augmentations more readily \
apparent. Jacob Greene echoes this claim in “From Augmentation to \
Articulation: (Hyper)linking the Locations of Public Writing,” arguing \
that the word “articulate” might be a more apt term. “Whereas \
‘augmentation’ ascribes to a rhetoric of addition-as-improvement, \
‘articulation,’...encourages us to approach location-based AR design as \
a process of creating and identifying emergent connections between the \
digital content of the application and its material surroundings” (2). \
Greene further argues that articulation “serves as a useful theoretical \
framework for understanding how temporary, contingent relations create \
emergent patterns of meaning” (9). In memorializing those who have died \
at Disney, Hidden Mortimers articulates the architectural discourse of \
the park to provide recognition for the deaths made invisible within the \
park’s construction.</p> \
\
<p>Ulmer argues that conventional memorials operate in accordance with a \
“public, collective value” in order to commemorate a sacrifice made. As \
we have mentioned earlier, Orlando’s Magic Kingdom was constructed as a \
monument to Walt after his death, and our peripheral thus negotiates \
that monument by continuing it and, in Ulmer’s words, “open[ing] to \
further thought the relation between private and public experience, \
individual and collective actions, events, behaviors” (130). Due to its \
reliance on triggers tied to the location of the deaths, the app forces \
us to walk through the park as a process of articulating our private \
relations to this public sacrifice. In constructing this electronic \
monument, our goal is not to instrumentalize those who have lost their \
lives towards a condemnation of Disney, but rather to ritualize our \
tourism and to acknowledge the abject sacrifices made in the \
construction of our entertainment.</p> \
