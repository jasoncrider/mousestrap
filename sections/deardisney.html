<p>Dear Walt Disney World Co. Outreach,</p>

<p>The <em>Orlando Sentinel</em> reported earlier this year that the Walt Disney
Company plans to connect its theme parks and hotels via an overhead gondola
system. A similar system, called the Skyway, once connected the different zones
of Walt Disney’s Magic Kingdom until it was closed in 1999 after the death of
Raymond Barlow, who was killed performing maintenance on the ride. We write to
request that the Walt Disney Company dedicate the new Skyway it is constructing
to Raymond Barlow, to be henceforth known as the “Raymond Barlow Memorial
Skyway.”</p>

<p>Although officially no relation was determined between safety concerns and
its decision to shutter the Skyway, neither the Magic Kingdom nor anywhere else
in the parks indicate Barlow’s death and his service to the Disney Company. He
died while maintaining the safety of the Skyway for the benefit and enjoyment of
park visitors, and as such we believe he deserves recognition in the form of the
Raymond Barlow Memorial Skyway. It is our hope that Disney and its many guests
honor the sacrifices that sustain its theme parks and resorts by reopening the
Skyway in Barlow’s memory.</p>

<p>We look forward to hearing from you soon,</p>

<p>Kenny Anderson and Jason Crider</p>
