<p>Disney Death Tour is not a parody of Walt Disney World or

<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>

<p>The <em>Orlando Sentinel</em> reports Disney’s plans to connect its theme parks and
hotels via an overhead gondola system. A similar system, the Skyway, connected
the different lands of the Magic Kingdom when I was a kid. I am writing in the
hopes that Walt Disney World honor the sacrifices which sustain its theme parks
and resorts by reopening the overhead gondola system as the Raymond Barlow
Memorial Skyway.</p>

<p>I remember my mother, who incidentally recently retired from
the Disney Company, telling me about a man who fell from the Skyway and died. I
remember wondering if it could happen to me. I think I remember seeing the
Skyway myself, though I would have been very young. It was torn down when I was
seven years old.</p>

<p>The man who fell was Raymond Barlow, a maintenance worker
employed with Disney until February 1999. He was working on the loading platform
when a ride operator inadvertently launched a gondola. It scooped him up and out
40 feet over the park as he clung to its side. When he couldn’t hold on any
longer, he fell through some tree branches and into a flower bed, dying. The
Skyway closed down six months later.</p>

<p>Disney denied any link between safety
concerns and its decision to shutter the Skyway. Nevertheless, neither the Magic
Kingdom nor anywhere else in the parks offer indicate Barlow’s death and service
to the Disney Company and the tourism industry.  He died while maintaining the
safety of the original Skyway for the benefit and enjoyment of park visitors. He
deserves recognition.</p>

<br>Kenny Anderson</p>

<h3>The Mouse and the Myth</h3>

<p>Did you know? “It’s company policy... [N]o one dies at Disney” (<em>Inside
the Mouse</em> 115). Depending on the source, when a tourist with a heart
condition goes lifeless on a roller coaster, medical
professionals by decree must wait to make the death pronouncement off-property.
Such a claim suggests corporate mediation so concentrated as to censor death
itself. Whether or not it can be verified through documentary evidence, in its
own way this “Disney death myth” characterizes power relations to the Walt
Disney Company and lends to its Orlando theme parks a sense of place.</p>

<p>Called a “Vatican with mouse ears” (qtd. in Clément 6), Disney holds
tremendous influence in Florida, where it employs more people than any other
company in the state, upwards of 56,000.  Local <a href="http://goo.gl/GhCFJY">policy</a>
often reflects Disney “flexing its bicep,” as one state senator put it. In 1967,
Florida’s House granted unrivaled autonomy to the company: a private charter
allows Disney to operate its parks independent of “state and county regulation
of buildings, land use, airport and nuclear power plant construction, and even
the distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages” (Foglesong 71). With its
propensity for shaping elections and securing favorable legal conditions, it might not
be so absurd to imagine Disney flexing its muscles to outlaw death too.</p>

<p>Of course, people do <a href="http://goo.gl/M8EfkP">die</a> at Disney World.
Most result from pre-existing conditions, some from accidents. Some result from
a horrifying collision of natural and built worlds: In 2016, two
year-old Lane Graves was  <a href="http://goo.gl/KmCcKQ">killed</a> by an alligator at
Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort and Spa. Florida theme parks report injuries and
deaths to the state Department of Agriculture, and Disney has had to pay fines
issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for safety
violations. Disney, however, has no obligation to publicize the deaths it cannot
control. But with the advent of mobile computing technologies, this project,
“Disney Death Tour,” reintroduces obscured narratives and their consequences
into restricted write-space.</p>

<p>Disney Death Tour commemorates those who have died at Walt Disney World. It
puts commercial tourism in conversation with critical spatial theory. As writing
studies enters its space age, Disney theme parks become sites where writing
technologies bring new civic potentials into focus. Structured as a guided tour,
Death Tour redirects the flow of foot traffic and installs an alternative
writing of theme park space. At the same time, it avoids above all else the
supremacy of any narrative; this is a writing, but neither Death Tour nor the
Disney Company can claim unilateral authority. Instead what this project makes
clear is the continual structuring and restructuring of space determined by its
participants.</p>

<p>Gregory L. Ulmer’s “MEmorial” genre offers a means of recognizing and
writing communal attitudes towards tragedy. Whereas traditional monuments
enshrine only official values, the MEmorial operates as an internet monument
that facilitates civic practices for rewriting public space. MEmorials bridge the
psychic distance between catastrophe and complacency by constructing a visceral
reminder of abject social sacrifices, in this case in the tourist industry: At
Disney World, you walk among the dead.</p>

<p>The tour starts with a single tragedy:</p>

<p><blockquote>“Raymond Barlow, 65, was on a platform for the Skyway in
Fantasyland when the cable-car ride was switched on for the park’s opening,
sending one of the gondolas toward the part-time worker. The startled Clermont
resident grabbed the four-person gondola and struggled to pull himself inside,
park employees told investigators. On the way up, he apparently was looking for
a place to land and let go over a flower bed, snapping some tree branches on the
way down, the workers said.” (<em>Orlando Sentinel</em>, “Worker At Disney
Plunges To His Death”)</blockquote></p>

<p>Although the Skyway was torn down six months later, and Disney was fined
$4,500 for “a ‘serious’ violation of safety standards,” the <em>Sentinel</em>
reported that “The ride’s closing is not a result of any concerns about its
safety.” As one commenter suggested, “Disney figured it could make better use of
the space.” At the time of this writing, the Magic Kingdom features no marker or
plaque memorializing Barlow’s fall, even though his sacrifice helps maintain
Disney World and, at a different scale, the tourist industry in general. Disney
Death Tour makes use of the space to better recognize similar abject losses.</p>

<img class="img-responsive center-block picture" src="img/yester-skyway.jpg">
<div class="caption"> <p>The “Skyway,” torn down in 1999.</p> </div>

<p>Barlow’s fall encapsulates some of Death Tour’s priorities. Power mediates
space both physically, as in tearing down a ride, as well as through discursive
construction. Conversely, as Sid Dobrin writes, “though one body orders a space
to a particular end, that order is not necessarily recognized or obeyed by all
who enter that space” (40). Corporations have images to maintain, which for
Disney means preserving its status as the happiest, most magical place on earth.
Space is carefully arranged to suppress or containerize the abject. Like a
designated smoking section, Disney confines death to the Haunted Mansion, where
the afterlife follows a script. In Barlow’s case, the official story dismisses
any link between safety concerns and the decision to close the Skyway, but the
claims of the powerful cannot assuage the death myth’s subversive appeal.
Locative computing technologies like augmented reality and this tour’s phone app
permit unsanctioned narratives into hypermediated corporate spaces.</p>

<p>Disney scrutinizes what enters and leaves its property such that
truth seems to circulate only in the off-record whispers of its employees:</p>

<p><blockquote>We had a guy last summer who went to EPCOT, stood under the golf
ball, took a gun, and blew his head off. But he didn’t die. He stood right there
in front of all those tourists and went “cluck” and brains blew everywhere. But
he didn’t die there. The medic told me that they are not allowed to let them die
there. Keep them alive by artificial means until they’re off Disney property,
like there’s an imaginary line in the road and they go, “He’s alive, he’s alive,
he’s dead.” (qtd. in <em>Inside the Mouse</em> 115)</blockquote></p>

<p>But Death Tour is premised on an urban legend. If veracity were the only metric for
a narrative’s value, this one hardly satisfies.  Online fact-checker <em><a href="http://goo.gl/AhVQBT">Snopes</a></em>
examines the claim, “Disney can legitmately [sic] claim that no one has ever
died at one of their theme parks, because they always ensure that accident
victims are removed from park property before being declared dead.” Though it
renders a “false” verdict, <em>Snopes</em> acknowledges “This legend is a tricky
subject to tackle, because it’s based upon the fine (and often confusing)
distinction between actual death and declared death.” Actual death becomes
declared death through an act of writing. Literate practices structure life and
death through writing. A birth certificate declares “this person is,” and a
gravemarker “this person was.”  The death myth suggests the believable (to the
extent that any legend is believable) potential of Disney to interrupt death
through writing. To clarify, Death Tour does not literally (or literately)
accept the death myth as law of the land. It instead explores how Disney deaths
circulate in a network of lore, industry, politics, place, and place-making.</p>

<p>Despite all efforts to control a corporate image, whether sinister or
practical, no imagineer can stop people from dying at Disney. In addition to
Barlow, around 30 people have died at Disney theme parks since 1977 (an exact
figure is difficult to cobble together). Most were the result of preexisting
conditions or natural causes, what one report calls “not surprising.” Some were
freak accidents. In many cases, families pursued legal action and reached
financial settlements with the Disney Company.</p>

<p>Death is downplayed but not denied outright. Under less litigious
circumstances, Disney World works with the Make-A-Wish foundation, offering some
source of comfort for terminally ill children and their families. And in a
gesture toward what Death Tour aims to further articulate, Disney <a href="http://goo.gl/WC6wDe">erected</a>
a lighthouse statue in memory of Lane Graves near the site of his death. Make no mistake, this is a complicated
and extremely sad matter. Unlike other paranoid conspiracy theories and academic
critiques aimed at Disney’s aesthetic formations, we are operating to
acknowledge these disasters in a serious and respectful way.</p>

<h3>Criticizing the Mouse</h3>

<p>Critical approaches to Disney theme parks are nothing new. In 1995, the
cultural studies ensemble The Project on Disney published <em>Inside the Mouse:
Work and Play at Disney World</em>, which conducts a critical examination of and
in Disney theme parks. In part the book is a model—it weighs the cognitive dissonance
of critics-turned-tourists (“The Problem with Pleasure”),
suggests playfully subversive negotiations of park space (“The Alternative
Ride”), and can’t resist a degree of anti-authority snark (“Working at the
Rat”). It also helps circulate the “no one dies at Disney” legend as a
counter-narrative which escapes corporate oversight. The Project on Disney
serves as a precedent, a source for the myth, and ultimately a point of
departure for the Disney Death Tour.</p>

<p>Thibaut Clément’s excellent review of literature, “‘Locus of Control:’ a
Selective Review of Disney Theme Parks,” traces this intellectual suspicion
toward mass entertainment. Efforts to identify the “locus of control”—the
<em>where</em> of meaning-making—in Disney’s parks traversed the
high-brow/low-brow debates of the last century. Critical hostility emerges as
early as 1958, when screenwriter Julian Halevy remarked, “[Disney parks] exist
for the relief of tension and boredom, as tranquilizers for social anxiety”
(qtd. in Clément 1). Other voices saw in Disneyland a restoration of the public
sphere, of performance and participation. Recent work finds the productive
rather than pessimistic possibilities in commercial tourist spaces. As opposed
to an early postmodern view of Disney parks as “sets of signs and
representations arranged into a discourse and intended to blur the distinction
between reality and fantasy,” Clément argues:</p>

<p><blockquote>In assigning various degrees of agency to the parks’
participants, critics have gradually displaced the locus of control for the
parks’ meaning, design, and operations from the Disney corporation to the
individual user and the company’s socio-economic context, paying increasing
attention to the audience’s interpretive activity and the parks’ competitive
environment. (8)</blockquote></p>

<p>He concludes, “Visitors are not ‘cultural dopes’ but rather actively
reconstruct available meanings to elaborate strategies and pursue motives of
their own” (8). Seeking the locus of control shifts from identifying the
presence of agency to the more nuanced assessment of “how much credit the parks’
various participants must be given in shaping and assigning meaning to the
parks’ environment” (9). Disney Death Tour extends “interpretive activity” by
reinscribing the space through digital writing implements. Assigning
“credit,” however, means thinking of writing and writing subjects participating
in complex, networked ecologies. As this project goes on to explore, and as
MEmorials help visualize, a locus of control cannot be neatly accounted for
because writing theory distributes the locus of subjectivity itself.</p>

<p>Including this selection of previous scholarship clarifies Disney Death Tour’s
intentions—what it is, and what it is not. Not an exposé revealing
corporate secrets, nor a critically aloof reading of Disney parks. Neither does
it state the obvious: of course visitors cultivate personal meanings in even the
most mediated of public spaces. Whereas previous critical work formulates Disney
parks in terms of either the passive reception of signs or the active
construction of individual interpretations, of dominant ideologies or subversive
subjectivities, Death Tour introduces new writings into the space itself. At the
same time, it is an exploration spatial writing theories. Death Tour employs as
much its methods–MEmorality, psychogeography, augmented reality, critical
tourism–as an inquiry into the limits of those methods.</p>

<h3>From Dark Tourism to Thanatourism</h3>

<p>Disney Death Tour uses tourism to explore a methodology of locative composition.
Death Tour performs critical tourism: embodied participation in public writing
spaces through commercial travel. Predating modern theme parks and cruise ships,
theoria names the ancient Greek practice of investigation through tourism.
According to Gregory Ulmer, the first theorists were also the first tourists
(5). Theoria “implied a complex but organic mode of active observation—a
perceptual system that included asking questions, listening to stories and local
myths, and feeling as well as hearing and seeing” (E. V. Walter, qtd. in
Electronic Monuments). These early theorists sought out facts obscured by rumor
and myth. Like theoria, Death Tour depends on physical travel and perceptual
attunement. Yet this is not a fact-finding mission. Rather, Walt Disney World
provides a high-profile site for demonstrating the tourist’s place-making
potential.</p>

<p>In his extended travelogue, “A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do
Again,” David Foster Wallace models an agency-surrendering hermeneutic approach
to commercial tourism: “I pay for the privilege of handing over to trained
professionals responsibility not just for my experience but for my
interpretation of that experience—i.e. my pleasure” (268). At the same time, he
attributes the willingness to cede narrative control to an underlying desire to
escape death:</p>

<p><blockquote>“I pay for the privilege of handing over to trained professionals
responsibility not just for my experience but for my interpretation of that
experience—i.e. my pleasure” (268). At the same time, Wallace attributes the
willingness to surrender agency to a deeper anxiety: A vacation is a respite
from unpleasantness, and since consciousness of death and decay are unpleasant,
it may seem weird the Americans’ ultimate fantasy vacation involves being
plunked down in an enormous primordial engine of death and decay. But on the 7NC
Luxury Cruise, we are skillfully enabled in the construction of various
fantasies of triumph over just this death and decay. (264)</blockquote></p>

<p>While not bitterly dismissive, Wallace forecloses tourism’s critically
interruptive capacity. His reading of “bovine” subjects to hyper-mediation
canonizes one limited version of tourism. A more critically aware tourism not
only disrupts such strict codification, it encourages invention of
counter-narratives emerging from embodied experience; the brochure says go this
way, but the critical tourist has no obligation to obey. To avoid reproducing a
containerized worldview, Death Tour shifts from analysis to invention. Still, “A
Supposedly Fun Thing” highlights the intermingling of death, pleasure, and
mediation at tourism’s core.</p>

<p>From the Greek root for death (θνῄσκω), thanatourism (Seaton 1996) describes
the allure of death through travel. Though often used interchangeably with “dark
tourism,” thanatourism connotes a more benign commingling of the two, whereas
“dark” casts a negative light. It might seem grotesque, but the purpose here is
not rubbernecking, or “milking the macabre” (Dann 1994). Functioning as a
MEmorial, Death Tour serves as a means of recognizing and reflecting upon
community values enshrined in collective sacrifices, making Walt Disney World
theme parks sites of civic pilgrimage. Or, put another way, the tour operates as
a form of memento mori for a networked civic sphere.</p>

<p>Thanatourism includes visits to battlefields, concentration camps, famous
gravesites, etc.—any attraction to sites of mass death or trauma. A modernist
practice, thanatourism coincides with mass media and culture. As J. John Lennon
and Malcolm Foley argue in Dark Tourism, for a tourist destination to be dark,
“global communication technologies play a major part in creating the initial
interest” (11). According to Lennon and Foley, the era of thanatourism begins
with two global-scale catastrophes: the First World War, an unprecedented
industrial clash of modern liberal democracies, and the sinking of the Titanic,
another death cruise given spectacular media coverage. Mirroring Ulmer’s
insights in Electronic Monuments, Dark Tourism posits dark destinations as a
means of reconciling individual experience and mass trauma through personal
encounter. Collective wounds also provoke reflection on the fatal consequences
of mass culture. As Lennon and Foley suggest, “the objects of dark tourism
themselves appear to introduce anxiety and doubt about the project of modernity”
(11). Disney, on the other hand, uses its global media engine to opposite ends,
where the “happiest” or “most magical” places on earth promote what Wallace
calls “fantasies of triumph” over death and decay.</p>

<p>Dark Tourism demystifies the fascination with death and tourism. Tourism, as
Lennon and Foley read it, grants a means of individual reconciliation with mass
cultural trauma. However, to restrict dark tourism to battlefields and
gravesites presents a limited scope of pre-digested coordinates on the map.
Interpreting particular tourist sites as distinctly “dark” discounts the
role—and the potential—of writing death into spaces designed to obscure it.
Taking into account recent efforts to develop more complex maps of writing,
ecology, space, and subjectivity, thanatourism describes a process of
theorizing, experiencing, and writing death alongside broadly defined public
writing spaces.</p>

<h3>Chōra: Bodies, Minds, and (Disney) World</h3>

<p>The study of rhetoric and composition has entered its space age. An intense
subset of the field seeks the where of writing, what Clément might call the
“locus of control”—how writing and writers shape and are shaped by place.
Previous models of intentional, localized writing subjects fail to account for
complex interactions of writers, technologies, and environs. Discussed by, among
others, Sid Dobrin, Byron Hawk, Gregory Ulmer, and Thomas Rickert, chōra helps
complicate and expand both static maps of writing as well as fixed notions of
place. As Rickert explains, “Plato’s chōra is an ancient attempt to think the
relation between matter and activity, work and space, background and meaning”
(Ambient Rhetoric 42). Applied to writing, chōra indicates the impossibly
complex relational networks which surround and bind the writing subject. To
“theorize subjectivity ambiently,” as Rickert suggests, abandons the search for
loci of control and leaves writing studies with a necessarily ethereal
metaphor.</p>

<p>Ambience informs this project’s critical approach to tourism. To contrast
with prior hermeneutic readings of Disney World, Death Tour should be viewed “in
terms of embedded and embodied immersion rather than connection, dispersed and
interactive flow rather than node, conditions of possibility rather than static
presence” (92). In relation to the tourist subject, chōric place cannot be
pinpointed on the map, but rather witnessed as an “affective, circulating, and
evolving series of encounters” (44). Disney’s Magic Kingdom sits at 28.417663°N
latitude, 81.581212°W longitude, but its sense of place is determined by how
people “come together in the continual making of a place; at the same time, that
place is interwoven into the way they have come to be as they are” (xiii).</p>

<p>Further examined in a later section, articulation promisingly accounts for
rhetorical co-determinacy between human and non-human agents. Whereas the
ethereal metaphor ambience suggests no immediate pedagogy, articulation makes
visible a composition practice which leaves open the possibility of alternative
writings. By engaging with Disney World—its symbols, lore, spatial arrangements,
and even the absent presence of death—the tourist and the tour articulate space
in Jacob W. Greene’s sense: “when a writer ‘articulates’ a location, she
discovers and creates relationships between the human and non-human entities
already circulating within it as potential rhetorical actors” (2017). The tour
(re)considers Disney World a place which obscures the fatal consequences of its
very existence, but site-specific death markers only partially fulfill Death
Tour’s intended use as “a responsive way of revealing the world for others,
responding to and put forth through affective, symbolic, and material means”
(162). The ambient thanatourist responds to space according to personal
histories, desires, sensations, etc., and space in turn alters the tourist’s
affective makeup. Thus, a map marker merely suggests points of disclosure in the
ambient sense: “itself manifold and ambient; it can be performed, practiced, and
activated in many ways, only so much of which will at any given time be directly
appropriable to consciousness, intention, or theorization” (72). Each encounter
with a Hidden Mortimer has the potential to alter the thanatourist by exposing
her to a previously undisclosed point of articulation. That point, however, does
not determine a particular vector, making it impossible to project this tour’s
intentional impact. Instead, thanatourism encourages articulation of space as a
“process of creating temporary, contingent connections [...] through which
familiar ideas begin to emerge as something new” (Greene 2017), yet never
insists upon narrative supremacy.</p>

<p>In contrast to David Foster Wallace’s luxury cruise, critical thanatourism
adopts William Bartram as a kind of Floridian proto-tourist. Discussed by
Madison Jones in his 2017 Association for the Study of Literature and
Environment (ASLE) presentation, Bartram paddled Florida’s Silver Springs and
wrote from his canoe’s emplaced vantage point, attuned to the unmediated
materiality of the Springs. The “emplaced composition” Jones develops from
Bartram’s example rescues material specificity from culturally mediated
abstraction. Toward a fuller articulation of place, this mapping reintroduces
specific loss, marking sites of nature’s most inescapable collisions with
culture. Disney Death Tour negotiates a rhetoricity of tourism that is always
already thanatourism.</p>

</section>

<p>Disney Death Tour is a MEmorial that  remembers those who have lost their
lives at Walt Disney World by identifying structural death necessitated by the
theme park and putting tourists face-to-face with mortality. However, as Ulmer
writes, the MEmorial is “not intended to condemn or pass judgment, but instead
visualize the invisible sacrifices made on behalf of certain cultural or
national values (xiii).” Such a high-profile location and iconic images like the
mouse ears demands we make this point clear: Disney Death Tour and the MEmorial
genre are meant to provoke, but not insult. Our intentions are deathly serious.
As a counter or alter-narrative to Disney’s highly mediated spaces and
depictions of death, Death Tour provides a means of rumination and reflection on
some of the often invisible consequences of modern tourism and entertainment.
Within composition studies, this MEmorial explores the possibilities of
electrate writing practices distinct from literate memorialization. An
alternative mapping with its AR counterpart further allows us to reintroduce
death as a crucial and often ignored part of the rhetorical process. Finally,
whereas other examples of MEmorial identify various deaths supporting abject
communal values, the theory of death is often left under-examined. The aim is
therefore not to ameliorate theme park fatalities—OSHA exists for that—but to
enter into widely-shared community space consideration of what we term “Death
Rhetoric.”</p>

<p>Our premise in its simplest form—grad students taking on a giant
corporation—sounds like something out of the movies, or the Old Testament. We
wanted to say something big, could say something (we have the technology), but
agonized over exactly why and how. Our drafts were a to-don’t list: do not
desecrate the dead, do not insult the living, do not merely expose the skeletons
in WDW’s closet, don’t be insensitive, don’t write a ten-thousand-word middle
finger to Diznee. In our concern not to instrumentalize the dead, to appropriate
tragedy for our creative or professional intents, these ethical considerations
provided the initial basis for a methodology. Of course the dead cannot speak
for themselves, and neither do we presume to write for them. Working through
what not to do made clearer what our writing was trying to do. In this section
we consider some of these ethics of mapping death, but move from ethical
reservations towards theories of writing at the limit of existence itself. As a
writing, not a reading, Death Tour responds to appeals from Scot Barnett and
Diane Davis to conceive of rhetoric and composition in ways which resist
containerized representations. Though this map gives only a crude representation
of those who physically died at Disney, indicating their hidden presence is a
step towards articulating the dead in a larger network of distributed identity,
what Ulmer identifies as “avatar.”</p>

<p>Barnett’s “Psychogeographies of Writing”
challenges compositionists to acknowledge and work creatively within the “limits
of representation” as we develop new maps of writing (and write new maps).
“Psychogeographies” guides many of the to-don’ts for this project. In one sense,
this alternative mapping of Disney World turns a smartphone into a can of
spray-paint, inscribing a corporate space with unsanctioned writings. Barnett,
however, problematizes these rebellious assumptions, arguing that “although
attempting to unmask and demystify hidden power relations can satisfy in the
short term, doing so also has the potential to leave in place the very thing we
hoped to transcend—in this case the problem of yet another representation of
space quietly asserting its own truth or authenticity” (xx). Disney Death Tour
attempts to demystify hidden power relations at work in Disney World, guilty. So
rather than insisting on one interpretation of Disney (a reading), a focus on
writing shifts attention to “those irreducible aspects of embodied
being-in-the-world that haunt the accounts we offer of ourselves but that may
never find a comfortable place in the discourses we rely upon to represent and
memorialize those accounts” (xx). Critical tourism is the participation through
travel in a contest for writing spaces. It involves the embodied experience of
being-in-the-world. In light of Barnett’s admonishments, composition scholars
must be careful not to replace one totalizing narrative with another and instead
acknowledge the limits of critiques contingent upon the limits of
representation.</p>

<p>For Barnett, citing Judith Butler, writing commits violence when
representations expect certainty from their subjects, or in  other words,
representation seeks essences. On this map one finds indications of physical
death, those who used-to-be-in-the-world. The challenge is to avoid doubling
down on “ethical violence.” Barnett comments,</p>
<p><blockquote>an act of ethical violence occurs
when we ask of the other the question ‘who are you?’ and demand in return a
satisfactory response capable of presenting a clear and coherent image of the
other’s self. Though often couched in the name of ethics, such acts, Butler has
argued, nevertheless demand of the other something she cannot possibly
provide—namely, an account of the self that is self-identical with the ‘I’ in
whose name she speaks. (“Psychogeographies”)</blockquote></p>
<p>Articulating death merely
exacerbates writing’s failure to represent what not even the living other can
present as a coherent self.</p>

<p>Representation’s inadequacy to account for the irreducible aspects of
being-in-the-world challenges the field to work against Barnett’s “discourses we
rely upon to represent and memorialize those accounts” (“Psychogeographies”).
This project treats skeptically the notion of simply preserving and retrieving
the memory of the dead through writing and mostly avoids those questions
altogether. We can acknowledge the limitations of writing as representation, but
how do we “see without knowing,” as Barnett calls for, and moreover, how do we
write without knowing? How do we leave “open and unresolved the impasse between
memory and the immemorial?” Barnett issues a challenge to which we must respond
if composition is to develop alongside these ethical and theoretical concerns.
But how in this project are we to find “a language that continuously interrupts
the will to craft a narrative out of memory?”</p>

<p>At this point, we offer as an interlude another prominent inquiry into death.
The long-form journalism podcast Serial first aired in October 2014. Over 12
episodes, Sarah Koenig exhaustively retraces the events surrounding the 1999
murder of Baltimore high school student Hae Min Lee (her body was discovered
mere days before Barlow’s fall, incidentally). Adnan Syed, the man imprisoned
for the crime, insists on his innocence. Koenig weighs his claim against
archival records, witness testimonies, and expert opinions, while forming a
working relationship with the personable Syed. Episode one begins with a brain
teaser: try to remember in detail what you were doing six weeks ago. If this
task proves difficult to answer with certainty, and as Koenig’s experiment
reveals, accounts are often revised or conflicting, consider that 1999 was 18
years ago at the time of this writing. Serial is a master work of investigative
journalism, but it also offers an extended demonstration of the challenges to
memory retrieval we work through here. The end of season one leaves personal and
legal judgments about Adnan unresolved and perhaps unresolvable.</p>

<p>Consider how often verbs like interrupts, challenges, frustrates, or leaves
unresolved occur in academic work. Now consider one response to the Adnan Syed
story eight episodes in: “Well then who the fuck did it?” The comment mirrors
going down the to-don’t list. Almost instinctively we demand to know. If we’re
not doing this, and we want to avoid saying that, then what the fuck are we
doing? In its expletive-inducing journalistic restraint, Serial reaches the very
limits of literate remembrance practices. Its refusal, or at least exhaustive
diligence not to reduce the complexities of lived experience to a snappy story
offers a model for how to leave “open and unresolved the impasse between memory
and the immemorial.” Serial ends with a big “I don’t know,” not for certain
anyway.</p>

<p>As discussed  in the previous section, emplacement forwards an ethics attuned
to the material specifics of place, engaged locally, in detail, rather than in
abstract tropes. In this sense, it might even  resemble a journalistic project.
In our eagerness to memorialize those who have died in a high-profile space we
risk the trap of “yellow journalism,” a kind of critical profiteering on top of
a failure to move beyond representation. To avoid containing the irreducible
complexities of lived experience to the obituary section of the newspaper, it
becomes essential to work past journalism as memorialization and into the
theoretical possibilities of MEmorialization as electrate writing practice of
civic engagement. Though it may be impossible  to substitute writing for the
memory of lived experience, we want to open a consideration of death’s
rhetoricity.</p>

<p>Diane Davis echoes Butler and Barnett’s concerns: “There is no longer any way
to pose [ontology’s] defining question, a question of uncontaminated essence:
‘What is X?’ There is no immanent or intrinsic being, no essence in itself that
would therefore be capable of presenting itself as such” (“A Rhetoric of
Responsibility”). But Davis shifts the conversation from taxonomy to rhetorical
and theoretical stakes. Drawing extensively from Jean-Luc Nancy, she identifies
a “preoriginary rhetoricty” in the condition of distributed being. According to
Nancy, being is always already contaminated by environs; the “singularity” of
the individual “designate[s] precisely that which, each time, forms a point of
exposure, traces an intersection of limits on which there is exposure. To be
exposed is to be on the limit where, at the same time, there is both inside and
outside, and neither inside nor outside.” This exposure, Davis says, “[Precedes]
symbolic identification … is relationality as such; it is constitutive of being,
which is always and only in the mode of exposition and not essence” (xx).
Barnett’s project seeks pre-reflective aspects of being-in-the-world. Davis
finds in the world a being-with that is always a being-for, a “solidarity that
precedes symbolicity” (15).</p>

<p>“A Rhetoric of Responsibility” makes clear the value of our project. Nancy
writes, “[W]hat community reveals to me, in presenting to me my birth and my
death, is my existence outside myself.” As Davis puts it, “Death marks the
absolute limit of identification and (so) of understanding … ‘[M]y’ finitude…can
communicate itself to me only through ‘your’ mortality.” Disney Death Tour puts
Walt Disney World visitors face to face with death. Nancy’s concept “face” does
not refer to nose and cheeks and skin, nor death’s skeletal personification, but
what Davis calls “the site of ‘my’ encounter with the inassimilable alterity of
the other, which provokes an interruption in identification and cognition” (xx).
She continues, “What one encounters in the face to face is the other’s finitude,
the other’s exposedness—that is to say, both his or her mortality…” At least in
theory, Disney Death Tour pinpoints grave sites of these potential encounters,
down to the latitude and longitude.</p>

<p>We answer composition with rhetoric not to ignore ethical violence, but
because Death Rhetoric is a constant reminder of the irreducible complexities of
lived experience. A reminder that, Davis argues, “Responsibility kicks in as a
response to finitude’s deadly intensity” (xx). Barnett tasks composition with
finding ways of “seeing without knowing.” Davis replies “Thinking is not the
same as knowing, and the challenge today, the social, ethical, and political
challenge is to learn to think the sharing of community without effacing
precisely this sharing by conceptualizing it, turning it into an object to be
grasped and put to work” (8). Death depictions like the Haunted Mansion offer a
containerized version of death without consequences. They arguably are not sites
of encounter one’s own mortality, and certainly not intended to be. We in turn
inscribe WDW with Hidden Mortimers. Whereas a headstone marks a literate
exercise in representation, perhaps our map markers should be thought of as
facestones, electrate renderings of death’s finitude. This tour challenges
indifference, “the luxury of exposed existents who are not faced with the fact
of their exposedness.” At these sites of encounter, “The face comes through each
time as pure appeal, persuasion without a rhetorician” (xx). Ultimately our
writing indicates not just death, but being’s pregnant solidarity realized when
“communal life holds itself ‘at a level equal to death.’”</p>

<p>So why Disney? In addition to WDW being the electrate academy, if we accept
Davis’s preoriginary rhetoricity, and death being the standard to which everyday
life should be held, then what’s needed is not better representations of death
in space, but more prominent reminders. The high-profile location is just plain
good PR. Furthermore, inventing electrate writing practices often means the
playful coining of neologisms and repurposing of old terms through puns. In our
case, death’s rhetorical appeal means revising the term “theme park,” which now
suggests inertia, a space of pause and recognition.</p>
