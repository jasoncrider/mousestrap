  <p>Dear Walt Disney World Co. Outreach,</p>

  <p>The <em>Orlando Sentinel</em> reported earlier this year that the Walt Disney
  Company plans to connect its theme parks and hotels via an overhead gondola
  system. A similar system, called the Skyway, once connected the different zones
  of Walt Disney’s Magic Kingdom until it was closed in 1999 after the death of
  Raymond Barlow, who was killed performing maintenance on the ride. We write to
  request that the Walt Disney Company dedicate the new Skyway it is constructing
  to Raymond Barlow, to be henceforth known as the “Raymond Barlow Memorial
  Skyway.”</p>

  <p>Although officially no relation was determined between safety concerns and
  its decision to shutter the Skyway, neither the Magic Kingdom nor anywhere else
  in the parks indicate Barlow’s death and his service to the Disney Company. He
  died while maintaining the safety of the Skyway for the benefit and enjoyment of
  park visitors, and as such we believe he deserves recognition in the form of the
  Raymond Barlow Memorial Skyway. It is our hope that Disney and its many guests
  honor the sacrifices that sustain its theme parks and resorts by reopening the
  Skyway in Barlow’s memory.</p>

  <br>
  <p style="text-align:right">We look forward to hearing from you soon,</p>

  <p style="text-align:right">Kenny Anderson and Jason Crider</p>

<p>“[T]he process of MEmorializing begins with a sting (punctum) received
from a news item, a story from the daily dose of information circulated by
journalism.”<br>—Gregory L. Ulmer, <i>Electronic Monuments</i></p>
<p>“A Walt Disney World custodian plunged 40 feet to his death Sunday morning
after clinging to the outside of a rising cable car that had swept him from a
platform.”<br>—<i>Orlando Sentinel</i>, 14 February, 1999</p>
</section>

<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> “It’s company policy... [N]o one dies at
Disney” (<em>Inside the Mouse</em> 115). Depending on the source, when a tourist with a
heart condition goes lifeless on a roller coaster, medical professionals by
decree must wait to make the death pronouncement off-property. Such a claim
suggests corporate mediation so concentrated as to censor death itself. Whether
or not it can be verified through documentary evidence, in its own way this
“Disney death myth” characterizes power relations to the Walt Disney Company and
lends to its Orlando theme parks a sense of place.</p>

<p>Called a “Vatican with mouse ears” (qtd. in Clément 6), Disney holds
tremendous influence in Florida, where it employs more people than any other
company in the state, upwards of 56,000. Local policy often reflects Disney
“flexing its bicep,” as one state senator put it. In 1967, Florida’s House
granted unrivaled autonomy to the company in the form of a private charter,
which allows Disney to operate its parks independent of “state and county
regulation of buildings, land use, airport and nuclear power plant construction,
and even the distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages” (Foglesong 71). With
its propensity for shaping elections and securing favorable legal conditions, it
might not be so absurd to imagine Disney flexing its muscles to outlaw death
too.</p>

<p>Of course, people often do die at Walt Disney World. While, most result from
pre-existing conditions, many are the result of accidents on rides or negligence
by the park. Some result from a horrifying collision of natural and built
worlds, like in 2016, when two year-old Lane Graves was killed by an alligator
at Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort and Spa. All Florida theme parks are required
to report injuries and deaths to the state Department of Agriculture, and Disney
has had to pay regular fines issued by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) for safety violations. Disney, however, has no obligation
to publicize these deaths, and despite the Orlando park itself being constructed
as a memorial to Walt’s death, Disney has constructed no such accompanying
monuments within the park to memorialize the numerous deaths of workers and
visitors that occur within that space. But with the use of mobile computing
technologies, our “Disney Death Tour,” offers a means of reintroducing these
marginalized narratives back into this restricted write-space, creating the
opportunity for users to rewrite their sensory experience of the park to include
collective mourning.</p>

<p>Disney Death Tour commemorates those who have died at Walt Disney World. It
puts commercial tourism in conversation with critical spatial theory. As
multimodal composition practices put writing studies into new negotiations with
space, Disney theme parks can become sites where writing technologies bring new
civic potentials into focus. Structured as a guided tour, the Death Tour
redirects the flow of foot traffic and installs an alternative writing of theme
park space that mirrors Jeff Rice’s use of digital logics to renegotiate
traditionally-conceived physical spaces in Digital Detroit. At the same time, it
challenges above all else the supremacy of any narrative; this is a writing, but
neither the Death Tour nor the Disney Company can claim unilateral authority.
Instead what this project makes clear is the continual structuring and
restructuring of space determined by its participants as made possible through
ubiquitous mobile computing technologies.</p>

<p>Gregory L. Ulmer’s concept of the “MEmorial” offers a means of recognizing
and writing communal attitudes towards tragedy. Whereas traditional monuments
enshrine only official values, the MEmorial operates as an internet monument
that facilitates civic practices for rewriting public space. MEmorials bridge
the psychic distance between catastrophe and complacency by constructing a
visceral reminder of abject social sacrifices, in this case in the tourist
industry—at Disney World, you walk among the dead.</p>

<p>Spatially, the tour can be experienced in any order, but temporally, it
begins with a single tragedy:</p>

<p><blockquote>“Raymond Barlow, 65, was on a platform for the Skyway in
Fantasyland when the cable-car ride was switched on for the park's opening,
sending one of the gondolas toward the part-time worker. The startled Clermont
resident grabbed the four-person gondola and struggled to pull himself inside,
park employees told investigators. On the way up, he apparently was looking for
a place to land and let go over a flower bed, snapping some tree branches on the
way down, the workers said.”  (<em>Orlando Sentinel</em>, “Worker At Disney Plunges To
His Death”)</blockquote></p>

<p>Although the Skyway was torn down six months later, and Disney was fined
$4,500 for “a ‘serious’ violation of safety standards,” the <em>Sentinel</em> reported
that “The ride's closing is not a result of any concerns about its safety.” As
one commenter suggested, “Disney figured it could make better use of the space.”
At the time of this writing, the Magic Kingdom features no marker or plaque
memorializing Barlow’s fall, even though his sacrifice helps maintain Disney
World and, at a different scale, the tourist industry in general. Disney Death
Tour makes use of the space to better recognize similar abject losses.</p>

<p>Barlow’s fall, and Disney’s subsequent response, encapsulate some of the key
spatial principles that the Death Tour explores. Power mediates space both
physically, as in tearing down a ride, as well as through discursive
construction. Conversely, as Sid Dobrin writes, “though one body orders a space
to a particular end, that order is not necessarily recognized or obeyed by all
who enter that space” (40). When entering a Disney park, space is ordered, but
not necessarily obeyed, as the Death Tour provides an alternative option for
occupying the park. Corporations have images to maintain, which for Disney means
preserving its parks’ status as the happiest, most magical places on earth.
Space is carefully arranged to suppress or containerize contradictory
narratives, in this case the deaths of parkgoers and workers. Like a designated
smoking section, Disney confines death to the Haunted Mansion, where the
afterlife follows a safe, playful script. In Barlow’s case, the official story
dismisses any link between safety concerns and the decision to close the Skyway,
but the claims of those constructing the narrative cannot assuage the death
myth’s subversive appeal. Without taking this myth’s appeal as factual truth,
our Death Tour operates according to its same subversive logic. As such, we use
locative computing technologies, like the augmented reality used in this tour’s
phone app, to permit unsanctioned narratives into these hypermediated corporate
spaces.</p>

<img class="img-responsive center-block picture" src="img/serling-tower.png">
<div class="caption"> <p>Rod Serling’s infamous smoking habit is airbrushed out of the Tower of Terror intro video.</p> </div>


<p>Disney scrutinizes what enters and leaves its property such that truth seems
only to circulate in the off-record whispers of its employees:</p>

<p><blockquote>We had a guy last summer who went to EPCOT, stood under the golf
ball, took a gun, and blew his head off. But he didn’t die. He stood right there
in front of all those tourists and went “cluck” and brains blew everywhere. But
he didn’t die there. The medic told me that they are not allowed to let them die
there. Keep them alive by artificial means until they’re off Disney property,
like there’s an imaginary line in the road and they go, “He’s alive, he’s alive,
he’s dead.” (Qtd. in <em>Inside the Mouse</em> 115)</blockquote></p>

<p>Death Tour is premised on an urban legend. If veracity were the only metric
for a narrative’s value, this one hardly satisfies. Online fact-checker Snopes
examines the claim, “Disney can legitmately [sic] claim that no one has ever
died at one of their theme parks, because they always ensure that accident
victims are removed from park property before being declared dead.” Though it
renders a “false” verdict, Snopes acknowledges “This legend is a tricky subject
to tackle, because it’s based upon the fine (and often confusing) distinction
between actual death and declared death.” Actual death becomes declared death
through an act of writing. Literate practices structure life and death through
writing: a birth certificate declares “this person is,” and a gravemarker “this
person was.” The death myth suggests the believable (to the extent that any
legend is believable) potential of Disney to interrupt death through writing. To
clarify, Death Tour does not literally (or literately) accept the death myth as
law of the land. It instead explores how Disney deaths circulate in a network of
lore, industry, politics, and place-making.

<p>Despite all efforts to control a corporate image, whether sinister or
practical, no imagineer can stop people from dying at Disney. In addition to
Barlow, over 30 people have died at Disney theme parks since 1977 (although an
exact figure is difficult to cobble together). Most were the result of
preexisting conditions or natural causes, what one report calls “not
surprising.” Some were freak accidents. In many cases, families pursued legal
action and reached financial settlements with the Disney Company.</p>

<p>Death is downplayed but not denied outright. Under less litigious
circumstances, Disney World works with the Make-A-Wish foundation, offering some
source of comfort for terminally ill children and their families. And in a
gesture toward what Death Tour aims to further articulate, Disney erected a
lighthouse statue in memory of Lane Graves near the site of his death. Make no
mistake, this is a complicated and extremely sad matter. Unlike other paranoid
conspiracy theories and academic critiques aimed at Disney’s aesthetic
formations, we are operating to acknowledge these disasters in a serious and
respectful way.</p>

<h3>Criticizing the Mouse</h3>

<section class="epigraph">
<p>“[A] subversive triumph at unearthing such slag so near to Disney’s golden portals.”
<br>—Carl Hiassen, <em>Team Rodent</em></p>
</section>

<p>Critical approaches to Disney theme parks are nothing new. In 1995, the
cultural studies ensemble The Project on Disney published <em>Inside the Mouse:
Work and Play at Disney World</em>, which conducts an examination of and in
Disney theme parks. In part the book is a model—it weighs the cognitive
dissonance of critics-turned-tourists (“The Problem with Pleasure”), suggests
playfully subversive negotiations of park space (“The Alternative Ride”), and of
course can’t resist a degree of anti-authority snark (“Working at the Rat”). It
also helps circulate the “no one dies at Disney” legend as a counter-narrative
that escapes corporate oversight. The Project on Disney serves as a precedent, a
source for the myth, and ultimately a point of departure for the Disney Death
Tour. Whereas these critical approaches to Disney offer readings, hermeneutics
for the park’s arrangement and the company’s actions, our approach enacts a
writing.</p>

<p>Thibaut Clément’s excellent review of literature, “‘Locus of Control:’ a
Selective Review of Disney Theme Parks,” traces this intellectual suspicion
toward mass entertainment. Efforts to identify the “locus of control”—the where
of meaning-making—in Disney’s parks traversed the high-brow/low-brow debates of
the last century. Critical hostility emerges as early as 1958, when screenwriter
Julian Halevy remarked, “[Disney parks] exist for the relief of tension and
boredom, as tranquilizers for social anxiety” (qtd. in Clément 1). Other voices
saw in Disneyland a restoration of the public sphere, of performance and
participation. Recent work finds the productive rather than pessimistic
possibilities in commercial tourist spaces. As opposed to an early postmodern
view of Disney parks as “sets of signs and representations arranged into a
discourse and intended to blur the distinction between reality and fantasy,”
Clément argues:</p>

<p><blockquote>In assigning various degrees of agency to the parks’
participants, critics have gradually displaced the locus of control for the
parks’ meaning, design, and operations from the Disney corporation to the
individual user and the company’s socio-economic context, paying increasing
attention to the audience’s interpretive activity and the parks’ competitive
environment. (8)</blockquote></p>

<p>He concludes, “Visitors are not ‘cultural dopes’ but rather actively
reconstruct available meanings to elaborate strategies and pursue motives of
their own” (8). Seeking the locus of control shifts from identifying the
presence of agency to the more nuanced assessment of “how much credit the parks’
various participants must be given in shaping and assigning meaning to the
parks’ environment” (9). Disney Death Tour extends “interpretive activity” by
reinscribing the space through digital writing implements. Assigning “credit,”
however, means thinking of writing and writing subjects participating in
complex, networked ecologies. As this project goes on to explore, and as
MEmorials help visualize, a locus of control cannot be neatly accounted for
because writing theory confounds the locus of subjectivity itself.</p>

<p>Including this selection of previous scholarship clarifies Disney Death
Tour’s intentions—what it is, and what it is not. Not an exposé revealing
corporate secrets, nor a critically aloof reading of Disney parks. Neither does
it state the obvious: of course visitors cultivate personal meanings in even the
most mediated of public spaces. Whereas this previous critical work formulates
Disney parks in terms of either the passive reception of signs or the active
construction of individual interpretations, of dominant ideologies or subversive
subjectivities, the Death Tour introduces new writings into the space itself. At
the same time, it is an exploratory spatial writing theory. Death Tour employs
as much its methods–MEmorality, psychogeography, augmented reality, critical
tourism–as an inquiry into the limits of those methods.</p>

<p>“In a move that simultaneously destabilizes and redistributes the ‘neat
boundaries’ of seemingly local, real-time interactions, Latour suggests
that we take care to examine how our interactions are ‘overflowing in
all directions’ making it virtually impossible for our analyses to start
(or stay) anywhere that can be said to be truly local (202)”
<br>—Jody Shipka, <i>Toward a Composition Made Whole</i></p>
</section>

<p>As a MEmorial, Disney Death Tour theorizes how we might write and rethink our
relationship to tourism and entertainment by memorializing those who have lost
their lives at Disney’s various theme parks. By enacting our MEmorial through an
augmented reality application, the parks themselves can be rewritten as sites of
mourning and memorial, generating what Ulmer calls the “inhabitable monument,” a
civic practice for an everted network (117). The emphasis on “me” in “MEmorial”
opens an investigation as to how we relate to the larger structure, in this case
Disney’s theme parks, and forces us to confront a shared experience of tragedy,
or in Virilio’s terms, the integral accident built into the park’s
infrastructure. While a traditional memorial might generalize these losses, the
MEmorial “[takes] up the paradox of group subjectivity in electracy” (118), and
experiments with placing the losses of a community in direct relation with
ourselves. As Sean Morey writes, a MEmorial allows individuals to not only
witness, but author their experience of a place in order to manifest individual
and collective mourning. In Morey’s Roadkill Tollbooth MEmorial, digital
monuments are dispersed along the Gulf Coast and down Highway One, marking sites
of significance from the Deepwater Horizon disaster, where “the traveler must
experience the total distance of a distributed memorial, picking up information
and clues from each stop that help understand the next” (“Roadkill Tollbooth”).
Like Morey’s Tollbooth MEmorial, our monuments are distributed throughout the
space they critically index, opening up new avenues for visitors to engage with
the park.</p>

<p>As travelers to Disney World in Orlando, we have chosen to confront the
losses of life that have been made invisible as we author our relations to the
park, Orlando, and Florida at large. Being citizens of Florida, especially so
close to Orlando, means we exist in an economy emboldened by the tourist and
entertainment industries. And being visitors to Disney’s parks means operating
within a community that does not actively acknowledge the deaths that occur as a
result of its existence. As we move throughout the park, we confront a
meticulously cultivated narrative with the taboo of death; by reconfiguring
ourselves within the networks of these communities, we negotiate values that are
not otherwise being acknowledged.</p>

<p>It is important to acknowledge that Walt Disney World in Orlando was
constructed as a monument to Walt Disney, and so in some sense the park’s
existence is always already about death. But within this monument there are
ongoing deaths that are not recognized, causing dissonance within the community.
As an electronic monument, Disney Death Tour theorizes how we might negotiate
this monument to account for these losses. As Ulmer states, “A first step in the
design of a MEmorial is to notice an abject loss that the community acknowledges
is a problem but that is not accepted as a sacrifice on behalf of a belief or
value structuring a group subject” (134). Rather than critiquing Disney’s
narrative as others have done, we instead offer this monument as an electrate
means of civic engagement, of shifting the park-as-monument to reflect a
forgotten community value.</p>

<p>Previous MEmorial projects have offered us a precedent on how we might
theorize our monument. Sean Morey’s “Deepwater Horizon MEmorial Roadkill
Tollbooth” “proposes an electrate alternative to memorializing the disaster of
the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010,” and works to theorize “how we might
write our relationship to nature differently through digital writing and digital
media,” and advocate for public policy change relating to the disaster. Madison
Jones and Jacob Greene’s “Augmented Vélorutionaries: Digital Rhetoric,
Memorials, and Public Discourse” employs a MEmorial through an augmented reality
mobile phone application that replaces removed ghost bikes, memorials emplaced
by a community to mourn cyclists killed by motor vehicles. And while not an
explicit MEmorial, Melissa Bianchi and Jacob Greene’s “SeeWorld: Visualizing
Animal Captivity Practices at SeaWorld Orlando” uses augmented reality to
provide a counternarrative that exposes the unethical treatment of animals at
SeaWorld.</p>

<p>These projects not only help situate the Disney Death Tour as what Madison
Jones describes as “emplaced composition,” (2017), but also as a digital writing
practice that forces us to be writers of the park rather than readers. As stated
earlier, the Disney Death Tour does not aim to critique Disney like countless
others have, but rather to construct  an image of the park that includes
ourselves, as well as otherwise forgotten members of its community. By writing
our image through multimodal writing technologies, we are engaging in what Jody
Shipka calls “new mediational means,” where we consider how new tools of
mediation alter not only the activities we engage in, but also how they
remediate our relationship to our bodies and surroundings (<em>Toward a
Composition Made Whole</em>, 48-50). When we configure the MEmorial as a
multimodal and emplaced writing practice, we begin to see composition, in
Shipka’s terms, as the result of an endlessly interconnected chain of events and
contexts, which then leads us to look at what contexts and histories are being
privileged (50-53). In the case of our tourism, it is not enough to simply
analyze our experience in a traditional sense, so we instead turn to an
electrate frame of reference for negotiating our image within the realities of
not only Disney, but also within the operations of the surrounding entertainment
culture at large.</p>

<p>In writing our electronic monument, we must reconcile the fact that we might
not like the image we see as we resituate ourselves within electracy. Morey
narrates this sentiment in the denouement of “Roadkill Tollbooth”:</p>

<p><blockquote>The practice of writing this MEmorial, even in the virtual,
relates to me how I relate to the disaster in the gulf, and how the disaster in
me relates to its cause, and those abject sacrifices which must pay the toll.
Now I must decide, as Ulmer states, if that image is me. If I recognize it, but
don’t like it, then I must produce my own change for the sake of all my
relations.</blockquote></p>

<p>By moving from a reading of the park to a writing of, from hermeneutics to
invention, we allow for what Ulmer describes as follows: “I catch sight of my
superego by appropriating an event that I recognize as somehow expressive of a
feeling. In this scene I recognize not so much my own history as the nature of
existence as I believe it to be (a metaphysical intuition).” Or in other words,
“I do not explain the problem; it explains me” (<em>Electronic Monuments</em>,
138).</p>

<h3>From Dark Tourism to Thanatourism</h3>

<p>Disney Death Tour uses tourism to enact a methodology of locative
composition. It performs <em>critical</em> tourism—embodied participation in public
writing spaces through commercial travel. While modern theme parks and cruise
ships are thought of in terms of their entertainment value, according to Ulmer,
the first theorists were also the first tourists (5). <em>Theoria</em>, the ancient Greek
practice of investigation through tourism, “implied a complex but organic mode
of active observation—a perceptual system that included asking questions,
listening to stories and local myths, and feeling as well as hearing and seeing”
(E. V. Walter, qtd. in <em>Electronic Monuments</em>). These early theorists sought out
facts obscured by rumor and myth. Like theoria, the Death Tour depends on
physical travel and perceptual attunement. Yet this is not a fact-finding
mission. Rather, Walt Disney World provides a high-profile site for
demonstrating the tourist’s place-making potential.</p>

<p>In his extended travelogue, “A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do Again,”
David Foster Wallace models an agency-surrendering hermeneutic approach to
commercial tourism: “I pay for the privilege of handing over to trained
professionals responsibility not just for my experience but for my
interpretation of that experience—i.e. my pleasure” (268). At the same time, he
attributes the willingness to cede narrative control to an underlying desire to
escape death:</p>

<p><blockquote>“I pay for the privilege of handing over to trained professionals
responsibility not just for my experience but for my interpretation of that
experience—i.e. my pleasure” (268). At the same time, Wallace attributes the
willingness to surrender agency to a deeper anxiety: A vacation is a respite
from unpleasantness, and since consciousness of death and decay are unpleasant,
it may seem weird the Americans’ ultimate fantasy vacation involves being
plunked down in an enormous primordial engine of death and decay. But on the 7NC
Luxury Cruise, we are skillfully enabled in the construction of various
fantasies of triumph over just this death and decay. (264)</blockquote></p>

<p>While not bitterly dismissive, Wallace forecloses tourism’s
critically-interruptive capacity. His reading of “bovine” subjects to
hyper-mediation canonizes one limited version of tourism. A more critically
aware tourism not only disrupts such strict codification, it encourages
invention of counter-narratives emerging from embodied experience; the brochure
says go this way, but the critical tourist has no obligation to obey. Still, “A
Supposedly Fun Thing” highlights the intermingling of death, pleasure, and
mediation at tourism’s core. To avoid reproducing a containerized worldview, the
Death Tour shifts from analysis to invention.

<p>Drawing from the Greek root for death, <em>thanatos</em> (θνῄσκω),
<em>thanatourism</em> (Seaton 1996) describes the allure of death through
travel. Though often used interchangeably with “dark tourism,” thanatourism
connotes a more benign commingling of the two, whereas “dark” casts a negative
light. It might seem grotesque, but the purpose here is not rubbernecking, or
“milking the macabre” (Dann 1994). Instead, by functioning as a MEmorial, the
Death Tour serves as a means of recognizing and reflecting upon community values
enshrined in collective sacrifices, making Walt Disney World theme parks sites
of civic pilgrimage. Or, put another way, the tour operates as a form of memento
mori for a networked civic sphere.

<p>Thanatourism includes visits to battlefields, concentration camps, famous
gravesites, etc.—any attraction to sites of mass death or trauma. A modernist
practice, thanatourism coincides with mass media and culture. As J. John Lennon
and Malcolm Foley argue in <em>Dark Tourism</em>, for a tourist destination to
be dark, “global communication technologies play a major part in creating the
initial interest” (11). According to Lennon and Foley, the era of thanatourism
begins with two global-scale catastrophes: the First World War, an unprecedented
industrial clash of modern liberal democracies, and the sinking of the
<em>Titanic</em>, a death cruise given spectacular media coverage. Mirroring
Ulmer’s insights in <em>Electronic Monuments</em>, <em>Dark Tourism</em> posits
dark destinations as a means of reconciling individual experience and mass
trauma through personal encounter. Collective wounds also provoke reflection on
the fatal consequences of mass culture. As Lennon and Foley suggest, “the
objects of dark tourism themselves appear to introduce anxiety and doubt about
the project of modernity” (11). Disney, on the other hand, uses its global media
engine to opposite ends, where the “happiest” or “most magical” places on earth
promote what Wallace calls “fantasies of triumph” over death and decay.

<p><em>Dark Tourism</em> demystifies the fascination with death and tourism.
Tourism, as Lennon and Foley read it, grants a means of individual
reconciliation with mass cultural trauma. However, to restrict dark tourism to
battlefields and  gravesites presents a limited scope of pre-digested
coordinates on the map. Interpreting particular tourist sites as distinctly
“dark” discounts the role—and the potential—of writing death into spaces
designed to obscure it. Taking into account recent efforts to develop more
complex maps of writing, ecology, space, and subjectivity, <em>thanatourism</em>
describes a process of theorizing, experiencing, and writing death alongside
broadly defined public writing spaces.</p>

<h3>Chōra: Bodies, Minds, and (Disney) World</h3>

<p>The study of rhetoric and composition has entered its space age. An intense
subset of the field seeks the <em>where</em> of writing, what Clément might call the
“locus of control”—how writing and writers shape and are shaped by place.
Previous models of intentional, localized writing subjects fail to account for
complex interactions of writers, technologies, and environs. Discussed by, among
others, Sid Dobrin, Byron Hawk, Gregory Ulmer, and Thomas Rickert, <em>chōra</em> helps
complicate and expand both static maps of writing as well as fixed notions of
place. As Rickert explains, “Plato’s <em>chōra</em> is an ancient attempt to think the
relation between matter and activity, work and space, background and meaning”
(Ambient Rhetoric 42). Applied to writing, chōra indicates the impossibly
complex relational networks which surround and bind the writing subject. To
“theorize subjectivity ambiently,” as Rickert suggests, abandons the search for
loci of control and leaves writing studies with a necessarily ethereal
metaphor.</p>

<p>Ambience informs this project’s critical approach to tourism. To contrast
with prior hermeneutic readings of Disney World, the Death Tour should be viewed
“in terms of embedded and embodied immersion rather than connection, dispersed
and interactive flow rather than node, conditions of possibility rather than
static presence” (92). In relation to the tourist subject, chōric place cannot
be pinpointed on the map, but rather witnessed as an “affective, circulating,
and evolving series of encounters” (44). Disney’s Magic Kingdom sits at
28.417663°N latitude, 81.581212°W longitude, but its sense of place is
determined by how people “come together in the continual making of a place; at
the same time, that place is interwoven into the way they have come to be as
they are” (xiii).</p>

<p>Further examined in another section, <em>articulation</em> promisingly accounts for
rhetorical co-determinacy between human and non-human agents. Whereas the
ethereal metaphor ambience might be difficult to actuate, articulation makes
visible a composition practice which leaves open the possibility of alternative
writings. By engaging with Disney World—its symbols, lore, spatial arrangements,
and even the absent presence of death—the tourist and the tour articulate space
in Jacob W. Greene’s sense: “when a writer ‘articulates’ a location, she
discovers and creates relationships between the human and non-human entities
already circulating within it as potential rhetorical actors” (2017). The tour
(re)considers Disney World as a place that obscures the fatal consequences of
its very existence, but site-specific death markers only partially fulfill it’s
intended use as “a responsive way of revealing the world for others, responding
to and put forth through affective, symbolic, and material means” (162). The
ambient thanatourist responds to space according to personal histories, desires,
sensations, etc., and space in turn alters the tourist’s affective makeup. Thus,
a map marker merely suggests points of <em>disclosure</em> in the ambient sense: “itself
manifold and ambient; it can be performed, practiced, and activated in many
ways, only so much of which will at any given time be directly appropriable to
consciousness, intention, or theorization” (72). Each encounter with a Hidden
Mortimer has the potential to alter the thanatourist by exposing her to a
previously undisclosed point of articulation. That point, however, does not
determine a particular vector, making it impossible to project this tour’s
intentional impact. Instead, thanatourism encourages articulation of space as a
“process of creating temporary, contingent connections...through which familiar
ideas begin to emerge as something new” (Greene 2017), yet never insists upon
narrative supremacy.</p>

<p>In contrast to Wallace’s luxury cruise, critical thanatourism adopts William
Bartram as a kind of Floridian proto-tourist. Discussed by Madison Jones in his
2017 Association for the Study of Literature and Environment (ASLE)
presentation, Bartram paddled Florida’s Silver Springs and wrote from his
canoe’s emplaced vantage point, attuned to the unmediated materiality of the
Springs. The “emplaced composition” Jones develops from Bartram’s example
rescues material specificity from culturally mediated abstraction. Toward a
fuller articulation of place, this mapping reintroduces specific loss, marking
sites of nature’s most inescapable collisions with culture. Disney Death Tour
negotiates a rhetoricity of tourism that is always already thanatourism.</p>

</section>

<p>Disney Death Tour identifies structural death at Disney theme parks,
reminding tourists of their own mortality. However, as Ulmer writes, the
MEmorial is “not intended to condemn or pass judgment, but instead visualize the
invisible sacrifices made on behalf of certain cultural or national values
(xiii).” The MEmorial in general, and Disney Death Tour specifically, are meant
to provoke, but not to insult. In terms of ambient tourism, the goal is not to
shame, but to engage with ambience so “as to (at least potentially) reattune or
otherwise transform how others inhabit the world to an extent that calls for
some action” (Rickert 162). As a counter-narrative to Disney’s highly-mediated
spaces and muted depictions of death, the Death Tour provides a means of
rumination on some of the invisible consequences of modern commercial tourism
and entertainment. Within composition studies, this MEmorial explores the
possibilities of electrate writing practices distinct from literate
memorialization. The alternative mapping capabilities enabled through its AR
counterpart further allow us to reintroduce death as a central but underexamined
part of the rhetorical process. And while other MEmorials identify various
deaths supporting abject communal values, often drawing upon “haunting” as a
metaphor for MEmorial and AR’s revelatory function, death’s theoretical
significance is left underexamined. The aim is therefore not to ameliorate theme
park fatalities—OSHA exists for that—but to enter what this project terms “Death
Rhetoric” into widely-shared community considerations of space.</p>

<p>The Death Tour confronts a tragic and sensitive subject, with the ethical
considerations informing a methodology—how to avoid appropriating the dead,
insulting the living, or merely exposing the skeletons in Disney’s closet. Of
course, the dead cannot speak for themselves, and neither would we presume to
write for them. Therefore this critical tour argues for a new ethics of mapping
death, one that confronts ethical reservations through theories of writing
informed by the limitations set by existence. As a writing, the Death Tour
responds to appeals from Scot Barnett and Diane Davis to conceive of rhetoric
and composition in ways that resist containerized representation. Though this
map gives a limited depiction of those who physically died at Disney, and where
those deaths occurred, indicating their hidden presence does take a step towards
articulating the dead in a larger network of distributed identity, what Ulmer
identifies as “avatar.”</p>

<p>Barnett’s “Psychogeographies of Writing” challenges compositionists to
acknowledge and work creatively within the “limits of representation” in order
to develop new maps of writing (and in turn write new maps). For Barnett, citing
Judith Butler, writing commits violence when representations expect certainty
from their subjects, or in other words, representation seeks essences. On this
map one finds indications of physical death, those who used-to-be-in-the-world.
The challenge is to avoid doubling down on “ethical violence.” Barnett
argues,</p>


<p><blockquote>an act of ethical violence occurs
when we ask of the other the question ‘who are you?’ and demand in return a
satisfactory response capable of presenting a clear and coherent image of the
other’s self. Though often couched in the name of ethics, such acts, Butler has
argued, nevertheless demand of the other something she cannot possibly
provide—namely, an account of the self that is self-identical with the ‘I’ in
whose name she speaks. (“Psychogeographies”)</blockquote></p>

<p>Articulating death merely exacerbates writing’s failure to represent what not
even the living other can present as a coherent self.</p>

<p>In one sense, this alternative mapping of Walt Disney World turns a
smartphone into a can of spray-paint, inscribing a corporate space with
unsanctioned writings. Barnett, however, problematizes these rebellious
assumptions, arguing that “although attempting to unmask and demystify hidden
power relations can satisfy in the short term, doing so also has the potential
to leave in place the very thing we hoped to transcend—in this case the problem
of yet another representation of space quietly asserting its own truth or
authenticity.” Yes, Disney Death Tour attempts to demystify hidden power
relations at work in Disney World, but rather than insisting on one
interpretation of Disney (a reading), a focus on the writing-tourist shifts
attention to what Barnett describes as “those irreducible aspects of embodied
being-in-the-world that haunt the accounts we offer of ourselves but that may
never find a comfortable place in the discourses we rely upon to represent and
memorialize those accounts” (“Psychogeographies”). Critical tourism is the
participation in a contest for writing spaces through travel, and involves the
embodied experience of being-in-the-world. In light of Barnett’s admonishments,
composition scholars must be careful not to replace one totalizing narrative
with another, and instead acknowledge the limits of critiques contingent upon
the limits of representation.</p>

<p>Representation’s inadequacy to account for the irreducible aspects of
being-in-the-world challenges the field to work against the “discourses we rely
upon to represent and memorialize those accounts.” This project treats
skeptically the notion of simply preserving and retrieving the memory of the
dead through writing and mostly avoids those questions altogether. We can
acknowledge the limitations of writing as representation, but how do we “see
without knowing,” as Barnett calls for? How do we leave “open and unresolved the
impasse between memory and the immemorial?” How in this project are we to find
“a language that continuously interrupts the will to craft a narrative out of
memory” (“Psychogeographies”)? Barnett issues a challenge to which composition
must develop theoretical responses to ethical concerns.</p>

<p>The limits of literate representation mark the space for inventing electrate
writing practices like MEmorial. Another prominent inquiry into death
exemplifies literacy and eletracy's divergent concerns. Over 12 episodes of the
journalism podcast <em>Serial</em>, Sarah Koenig thoroughly examines the 1999 murder of
high school student Hae Min Lee (footnote). Adnan Syed, the man imprisoned for
the crime, insists on his innocence. Koenig weighs his claim against archival
records, witness testimonies, and expert opinions. Episode one begins with a
memory exercise: try to remember in detail what you were doing six weeks ago. If
the task proves difficult to answer with certainty, and as Koenig’s experiment
reveals, accounts are often revised or conflicting, consider that 1999 was 18
years ago at the time of this writing. <em>Serial</em> is a master work of investigative
journalism, but it also demonstrates the limits of written memorialization. The
season finale leaves personal and legal judgments about Adnan Syed unresolved
and perhaps unresolvable.</p>

<p>Journalistic objectivity tends toward containerization, the demand to know
for the record. When a figure like Syed resists tidy representations, and when a
journalistic account reaches its disciplinary limits, the result can be
frustrating. As one commenter exclaims in episode eight, “Well then who the fuck
did it?” In its expletive-inducing journalistic restraint, Serial reaches the
very limits of literate remembrance practices. Koenig ends with a big “I don’t
know,” not for certain anyway. Her exhaustive diligence not to reduce the
complexities of lived experience to a snappy story resembles a Butlerian
journalistic ethic. Working as an extension beyond the containerization of
literate journalism, the MEmorial then “begins with a sting (punctum) received
from a news item, a story from the daily dose of information circulated by
journalism” (Ulmer xx). Electrate writing practices do not displace but extend
literate journalism. In response to Barnett, MEmorials seek not better
containers, but alternative approaches.</p>

<h3>Thinking without Knowing</h3>

<p>As discussed in the Thanatourism section, emplacement forwards an ethics
attuned to the material specifics of place, engaged locally, in detail, rather
than in abstract tropes. In this sense, emplacement resembles a journalistic
project. To avoid containing the irreducible complexities of lived experience to
the obituary section of the newspaper, it becomes essential to work past
journalism as memorialization and into the theoretical possibilities of
MEmorialization as an electrate writing practice for civic engagement. Though it
may be impossible to substitute writing for the memory of lived experience, the
Death Tour opens a consideration of death’s rhetoricity.</p>

<p>In her introduction to <em>Inessential Solidarity</em>, Diane Davis argues
that what Butler and Barnett treat as concerns to be avoided are in reality
impossible altogether: “There is no longer any way to pose [ontology’s] defining
question, a question of uncontaminated essence: ‘What is X?’ There is no
immanent or intrinsic being, no essence in itself that would therefore be
capable of presenting itself as such” (4). Davis shifts the stakes from
taxonomical to rhetorical and theoretical. Drawing extensively from Jean-Luc
Nancy, she identifies a “preoriginary rhetoricty” in the condition of
distributed being. According to Nancy, being is always already contaminated by
community and environs; the “singularity” of the individual “designate[s]
precisely that which, each time, forms a point of exposure, traces an
intersection of limits on which there is exposure. To be exposed is to be on the
limit where, at the same time, there is both inside and outside, and neither
inside nor outside.” This exposure, Davis says, “[Precedes] symbolic
identification … is relationality as such; it is constitutive of being, which is
always and only in the mode of exposition and not essence” (7). Barnett’s
project seeks pre-reflective aspects of being-in-the-world. Davis finds in the
world a being-with that is always a being-for, a “solidarity that precedes
symbolicity” (15).</p>

<p>“A Rhetoric of Responsibility” makes it clear that the role of dying at
Disney extends beyond mere morbid fascination. Nancy writes, “what community
reveals to me, in presenting to me my birth and my death, is my existence
outside myself” (10). As Davis puts it, “Death marks the absolute limit of
identification and (so) of understanding … ‘my’ finitude…can communicate itself
to me only through ‘your’ mortality.” Disney Death Tour puts Walt Disney World
visitors face-to-face with death. Nancy’s concept “face” does not refer to nose
and cheeks and skin, nor death’s skeletal personification, but what Davis calls
“the site of ‘my’ encounter with the inassimilable alterity of the other, which
provokes an interruption in identification and cognition” (12). She continues,
“What one encounters in the face to face is the other’s finitude, the other’s
exposedness—that is to say, both his or her mortality…” By pinpointing Disney
deaths down to latitude and longitude, the Death Tour literalizes the processes
of exposure in order to visualize sites of encounter.</p>

<p>However, Death Rhetoric is not a means of reducing the complexities of
rhetorical being to simple map markers, but of articulating a reminder that, as
Davis argues, “Responsibility kicks in as a response to finitude’s deadly
intensity” (11). Barnett tasks composition with finding ways of “seeing without
knowing.” Davis replies, “Thinking is not the same as knowing, and the challenge
today, the social, ethical, and political challenge is to learn to think the
sharing of community without effacing precisely this sharing by conceptualizing
it, turning it into an object to be grasped and put to work” (8). Death
depictions like the Haunted Mansion offer a containerized version of death
without consequences. They are not sites of encountering one’s own mortality,
and are certainly not intended to be. In response to Disney’s glossy
performances of death, the Death Tour inscribes Walt Disney World with “Hidden
Mortimers,” a play on the “Hidden Mickeys” scattered throughout Disney parks.
Whereas headstones mark a literate exercise in representation, perhaps these map
markers should be thought of as facestones, electrate renderings of death’s
finitude. This tour challenges indifference, “the luxury of exposed existents
who are not faced with the fact of their exposedness.” At these sites of
encounter, “The face comes through each time as pure appeal, persuasion without
a rhetorician” (14). Ultimately, the Death Tour indicates not just death, but
being’s underlying solidarity—being-for—realized when “communal life holds
itself ‘at a level equal to death’” (10).</p>

<p>Obviously this formulation of space applies everywhere, not just Disney
World. But if we accept Davis’s preoriginary rhetoricity, and death as the
standard to which everyday life should be held, then what’s needed is not better
representations of death in space, but more useful reminders. Furthermore,
inventing electrate writing practices often means the playful coining of
neologisms and repurposing of old terms through puns. In our case, death’s
rhetorical appeal means revising the term “theme park” to suggest inertia,
pause, and recognition.</p>

followed her with the laptop, careful of the cable. She felt as if he were
holding his breath. She was holding hers.”
<br>—William Gibson, <i>Spook Country</i></p>
</section>

<p>William Gibson’s 2007 novel <em>Spook Country</em> features an avant-garde
augmented reality artist, Alberto Corrales, who creates “invisible virtual
monuments” to dead celebrities as art installations throughout Hollywood (49).
Corrales’ first installation features the reenacted death of River Phoenix
outside of the Viper Lounge, Johnny Depp’s nightclub in West Hollywood. Like all
of Corrales’ installations, the scene of the death is viewed through an
AR-capable headset at the site of its occurrence, and thus exists as a mixed
reality, location-based composition. If everyone had these headsets, Corrales
envisions, “the world we walk around in would be channels” (46). Of course, with
the ubiquity of the smartphone, everyone now <em>does</em> walk around with
these headsets in a way, and these channels are increasingly being realized.
This is one of many ways Gibson explores the rise of ubicomp, AR, and locative
media throughout the novel as a means of amending the “cyberspace” metaphor he
first coined in “Burning Chrome,” and later popularized in <em>Neuromancer</em>.
Gibson’s calls his updated metaphor “eversion,” the idea that the network is no
longer imagined as an ethereal substratum existing in a second order to humans,
but rather a physical artifact with tangible relations and consequences.</p>

<p>The eversion metaphor echos digital humanities scholar Steven Jones’ claim of
augmented reality’s primacy as our contemporary metaphor for digital spaces.
Jones writes: “the augmented has displaced the virtual, and computing has gone
mobile and locative;” AR, or mixed reality’s, collapsing of digital and physical
spaces forces the construction of new practices and questions that “address the
social, locative, embodied, and object-oriented nature of our experience in the
networked world” (14). To this end, the Death Tour serves to enact an everted
critique at the site of Disney’s Magic Kingdom, an embodied and site-specific
mixed reality intervention that invites park visitors to negotiate the
narratives and dimensionalities they experience throughout the park.</p>

<p>Our choice of augmented reality as the specific medium for constructing the
Death Tour serves dual functions. The first is simple pragmatism—the AR
apparatus provides a means of interfacing with an everted network, one of
Corrales’ “channels,” in a mobile, streamlined manner. In this sense it follows
Andries van Dam’s claim that “the best interface is no interface—‘I think,
therefore the computer gives me what I thought about (and what I should think
about)’” (64). In other words, the AR underpinnings enable a clean electrate
app/aratus that is both immediate and unburdensome, a pocket-sized
countermonument that operates without the cumbersome headset imagined in
Gibson’s novel. Second, AR as a medium holds deeper significance for the ways in
which this project is rendered. As such, we take up Lev Manovich’s call in “The
poetics of augmented space” to “reconceptualize augmentation as an idea and
cultural and aesthetic practice rather than as a technology” (220). Marshall
McLuhan’s famous quip throughout <em>Understanding Media</em>, “the medium is
the message,” certainly holds sway here. But perhaps more aptly, we take up Neil
Postman’s claim that the medium is instead the metaphor. The AR metaphor enacted
through the Disney Death Tour is not one as distasteful as communing with
spirits or disturbing a haunted space, but instead one that implements AR as a
poetics for interfacing with erasure. As Greene and Jones argue, “location-based
AR criticism operates rhetorically not to overwhelm the user with information,
statistics, and research but rather to open up affective avenues through which
alternative public discourses about a location might emerge.” In other words, we
are not interested in communing with the “spooks” from Gibson’s <em>Spook
Country</em> (which he defines as both “specter, ghost, revenant” and “slang for
‘intelligence agent’”), but rather in how an augmented medium both theorizes and
catalyzes a negotiable public discourse through approaching its design and
implementation as, in Manovich’s words, “an architectural problem.” By creating
digital memorials at fixed locations within the park, this AR application
invites park visitors to ritualize and reflect on the augmentations with which
they choose to interface.</p>

<p>Nathan Jurgenson puts this similarly in “Always Already Augmented,” a
reflection on the location-based AR game <em>Pokémon Go</em>:</p>

<p><blockquote><[I]t is misleading to oppose the real to the augmented.
Wandering through town we encounter a deeply augmented reality even if we are
not playing <em>Pokemon Go</em>, not carrying a screen with us. From billboards
overhead to the sounds of music from passing cars to the architecture of
surrounding buildings to the city planning it all rests on, reality is augmented
everywhere at every moment. And that’s not even considering the deeper
augmentations of cultural norms, or the structures of language itself. Language
is built on “augmenting” what is “here and now” with a record of ideas and
people and actions that transcend time and space and presence.</blockquote></p>

<p>For Jurgenson, “reality” is only distinguishable from “augmented reality” in
that its augmentations have been naturalized and thus operate invisibly. What
Pokémon Go offers is a disruption of this naturalization, one that makes certain
augmentations more readily apparent, or, to borrow from Rickert, provides
“salience.” Greene echoes this claim, arguing that the word “articulate” might
be a more apt term. “Whereas ‘augmentation’ ascribes to a rhetoric of
addition-as-improvement, ‘articulation,’...encourages us to approach
location-based AR design as a process of creating and identifying emergent
connections between the digital content of the application and its material
surroundings.” Greene further argues that articulation “serves as a useful
theoretical framework for understanding how temporary, contingent relations
create emergent patterns of meaning” (2017). In memorializing those who have
died at Disney, the Death Tour articulates the architectural discourse of the
park to provide recognition for the deaths made invisible within the park’s
construction.</p>

<p>Ulmer argues that conventional memorials operate in accordance with a
“public, collective value” in order to commemorate a sacrifice made. As we have
mentioned earlier, Orlando’s Magic Kingdom was constructed as a monument to Walt
after his death, and our peripheral thus negotiates that monument by continuing
it and, in Ulmer’s words, “open[ing] to further thought the relation between
private and public experience, individual and collective actions, events,
behaviors” (130). Due to its reliance on triggers tied to the location of the
deaths, the app renegotiates users’ movement through the park as a process of
rearticulating their private relations to this public sacrifice. In constructing
this electronic monument, our goal is not to instrumentalize those who have lost
their lives towards a condemnation of the Disney Company, but rather to
ritualize our tourism and to acknowledge the abject sacrifices made in the
construction of our entertainment.</p>

<section class="epigraph">
<p>“I kissed my first girl while wearing a glow-in-the-dark Haunted Mansion shirt”
<br>—Cory Doctorow</p>

<p>“By an extraordinary coincidence (but this derives without a doubt from
the enchantment inherent to this universe), this frozen, childlike world
is found to have been conceived and realized by a man who is himself now
cryogenized: Walt Disney, who awaits his resurrection through an increase
of 180 degrees centigrade.”
<br>—Jean Baudrillard, <i>Simulacra and Simulation</i></p>
</section>

<h3>Memento (ME)mori(al)</h3>

<p>While the myth of Walt’s cryogenically frozen body is certainly compelling,
it is also undeniably untrue. Baudrillard’s mythologizing of Disney enacts the
same kind of covering up that critics of the Disney Company so often hinge their
critiques on. In reality, Walt was cremated two days after his death, as a
result of complications from lung cancer (Gabler 626). Walt was a heavy smoker
for much of his life, and it led to his death in 1966 at the age of 65.</p>

<p>Rearticulating the Disney-World-as-monument through the Death Tour,
necessitates consideration of the ways The Walt Disney Company itself
articulates death throughout its parks. Most notable is the case of Walt
himself, whose many portraits and various other photographs throughout the park
have had the cigarettes carefully airbrushed from them, often leaving two
fingers delicately pointing towards nothing, or awkwardly extended in front of
him; some of these images still contain a faint smoke from the missing
cigarette, a secondhand reminder of what killed Walt (Cade). Tom Hanks even
mimicked the artificial two-finger point in his portrayal of Walt in the 2013
film <em>Saving Mr. Banks</em>, yet another depiction void of smoking but not of
smoke (Buerger). We are not interrogating the ethics of a revisionist approach
to Walt’s image here, but would like to emphasize that this seems endemic of a
deep cultural unease with death enacted throughout these parks.</p>

<p>That being said, there is one location at Walt Disney World that does portray
death—the Haunted Mansion, the Orlando version of which opened in 1971. No
deaths have been reported on the ride, but that has not negated its mythic
depth. One ride operator interviewed explains that the ride shuts down several
times a year to clean up ashes spread by park guests, presumably of loved ones
who held a meaningful connection to the ride. When inquiring if the ashes are
collected and stored somewhere, we were told that the process instead involves
brooms and vacuums. While this is a rumor in the strictest sense, it would
indicate that the playful irreverence of the attraction might bleed into the
logic of yet another of Disney’s death procedures. Highlight this example
suggests that a playful logic at Disney can have stark consequences, and that a
subtle shift in this logic through the inventive structures of electracy can
hold meaningful sway in constructing a spirited, inclusive image of death in
collective mourning.</p>

<p>And perhaps this used to be the case. Memento Mori, the gift shop supplement
of the Haunted Mansion, once sold customizable death certificates, playful
compositions that juxtaposed the living with the dead. While these are no longer
purchasable, the shop now offers “Spirit Photographs,” personalized 8x10”
holographic portraits that, upon tilting, morph one’s face into that of a
ghoul’s. And even today the ghouls and phantoms darting around within the walls
of the Haunted Mansion engage in some of the only implementation of augmented
reality within the park, as if Disney itself were instrumentalizing  the
technology as one of communing with the dead. Their mixed reality dancing indeed
inspired our own haunting of the park, our own Spirit Photography MEmorial that
works within the preexisting electrate logics of Walt Disney World.</p>

<h3>Monumental Mice</h3>

<p>It goes without saying that Mickey Mouse serves as more than just the
official mascot of The Walt Disney Company, but also one of the most famous
cartoon characters in the world. However the iconic mouse was originally named
Mortimer, a name often associated with death and the grim reaper, with clear
etymological traces to Middle English and Latin (<em>mors</em> and
<em>mort</em>-, death). At the behest of Walt’s wife Lillian, the name was
changed to Mickey, on the basis of the name Mortimer being too pretentious. But
Mortimer did eventually become a character in the Disney Universe, making his
first appearance as the villain “Mr. Slicker” in the 1930 comic strip “Mr.
Slicker and the Egg Robbers,” and his first appearance with the name Mortimer
Mouse six years later in the animated short “Mickey’s Rival,” where he firmly
cements his place in Disney’s history as Mickey’s primary antagonist.</p>

<p>A psychoanalytic or hermeneutic interpretation of this might view Mortimer
Mouse as a repressed death drive or id. Suppressing the mouse’s true Mortimer
nature by naming him Mickey, causes a villain bearing the name to surface. Of
course, the Death Tour considers Mortimer in a difference
sense—instrumentalizing him as a mascot for death within the borders of Disney
World. Although most other villains have their own mascots within the park,
there has never been a live Mortimer.</p>

<p>Implementing the Mortimer mascot to rewrite the images of hidden deaths
throughout the park, riffs off of Disney’s “Hidden Mickeys,” the concealed
insertions of the iconic tri-circle Mickey head throughout Disney parks. Just as
Hidden Mickeys started as an in-joke between early Disney Imagineers and has
become a favorite means of secretly participating in the parks’ community
(Roseboom), the Death Tour MEmorial began as a shared, hidden means of rewriting
the park, one offered up to the larger community. Just as Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle’s Dr. Mortimer asks Sherlock Holmes to investigate the death of his friend
in <em>The Hound of the Baskervilles</em>, so too do these Mortimers call for a
closer examination, a second look at what it means to be a visitor of the parks.
This memento mori is not a morbid or repressed action, but rather an attempt at
an electrate reflection on death.</p>

<p><strong>Authors’ Note:</strong> “Punctum notification” refers to both the “sting” of
experiencing personal revelation, as well as to mobile phones’ use of “push”
notifications to display up-to-date information as it becomes available. Jacob
Greene and Madison Jones suggest that mobile-phone MEmorials could utilize
GPS-based push functionality so that “members of the public could not avoid
knowing that death occurred at this location.” As for the “punctum” side of
things, because of the its personal nature, we haven’t yet decided how to write
about ourselves in this piece. It seems important to include personal narrative,
since the Barlow story which spurred this project came from family folklore, but
we’ve decided to wait for suggestions from outside readers before committing one
way or another.</p>
