<h3>From Dark Tourism to Thanatourism</h3>

<p>Disney Death Tour uses tourism to explore a methodology of locative composition.
Death Tour performs critical tourism: embodied participation in public writing
spaces through commercial travel. Predating modern theme parks and cruise ships,
theoria names the ancient Greek practice of investigation through tourism.
According to Gregory Ulmer, the first theorists were also the first tourists
(5). Theoria “implied a complex but organic mode of active observation—a
perceptual system that included asking questions, listening to stories and local
myths, and feeling as well as hearing and seeing” (E. V. Walter, qtd. in
Electronic Monuments). These early theorists sought out facts obscured by rumor
and myth. Like theoria, Death Tour depends on physical travel and perceptual
attunement. Yet this is not a fact-finding mission. Rather, Walt Disney World
provides a high-profile site for demonstrating the tourist’s place-making
potential.</p>

<p>In his extended travelogue, “A Supposedly Fun Thing I’ll Never Do
Again,” David Foster Wallace models an agency-surrendering hermeneutic approach
to commercial tourism: “I pay for the privilege of handing over to trained
professionals responsibility not just for my experience but for my
interpretation of that experience—i.e. my pleasure” (268). At the same time, he
attributes the willingness to cede narrative control to an underlying desire to
escape death:</p>

<p><blockquote>“I pay for the privilege of handing over to trained professionals
responsibility not just for my experience but for my interpretation of that
experience—i.e. my pleasure” (268). At the same time, Wallace attributes the
willingness to surrender agency to a deeper anxiety: A vacation is a respite
from unpleasantness, and since consciousness of death and decay are unpleasant,
it may seem weird the Americans’ ultimate fantasy vacation involves being
plunked down in an enormous primordial engine of death and decay. But on the 7NC
Luxury Cruise, we are skillfully enabled in the construction of various
fantasies of triumph over just this death and decay. (264)</blockquote></p>

<p>While not bitterly dismissive, Wallace forecloses tourism’s critically
interruptive capacity. His reading of “bovine” subjects to hyper-mediation
canonizes one limited version of tourism. A more critically aware tourism not
only disrupts such strict codification, it encourages invention of
counter-narratives emerging from embodied experience; the brochure says go this
way, but the critical tourist has no obligation to obey. To avoid reproducing a
containerized worldview, Death Tour shifts from analysis to invention. Still, “A
Supposedly Fun Thing” highlights the intermingling of death, pleasure, and
mediation at tourism’s core.</p>

<p>From the Greek root for death (θνῄσκω), thanatourism (Seaton 1996) describes
the allure of death through travel. Though often used interchangeably with “dark
tourism,” thanatourism connotes a more benign commingling of the two, whereas
“dark” casts a negative light. It might seem grotesque, but the purpose here is
not rubbernecking, or “milking the macabre” (Dann 1994). Functioning as a
MEmorial, Death Tour serves as a means of recognizing and reflecting upon
community values enshrined in collective sacrifices, making Walt Disney World
theme parks sites of civic pilgrimage. Or, put another way, the tour operates as
a form of memento mori for a networked civic sphere.</p>

<p>Thanatourism includes visits to battlefields, concentration camps, famous
gravesites, etc.—any attraction to sites of mass death or trauma. A modernist
practice, thanatourism coincides with mass media and culture. As J. John Lennon
and Malcolm Foley argue in Dark Tourism, for a tourist destination to be dark,
“global communication technologies play a major part in creating the initial
interest” (11). According to Lennon and Foley, the era of thanatourism begins
with two global-scale catastrophes: the First World War, an unprecedented
industrial clash of modern liberal democracies, and the sinking of the Titanic,
another death cruise given spectacular media coverage. Mirroring Ulmer’s
insights in Electronic Monuments, Dark Tourism posits dark destinations as a
means of reconciling individual experience and mass trauma through personal
encounter. Collective wounds also provoke reflection on the fatal consequences
of mass culture. As Lennon and Foley suggest, “the objects of dark tourism
themselves appear to introduce anxiety and doubt about the project of modernity”
(11). Disney, on the other hand, uses its global media engine to opposite ends,
where the “happiest” or “most magical” places on earth promote what Wallace
calls “fantasies of triumph” over death and decay.</p>

<p>Dark Tourism demystifies the fascination with death and tourism. Tourism, as
Lennon and Foley read it, grants a means of individual reconciliation with mass
cultural trauma. However, to restrict dark tourism to battlefields and
gravesites presents a limited scope of pre-digested coordinates on the map.
Interpreting particular tourist sites as distinctly “dark” discounts the
role—and the potential—of writing death into spaces designed to obscure it.
Taking into account recent efforts to develop more complex maps of writing,
ecology, space, and subjectivity, thanatourism describes a process of
theorizing, experiencing, and writing death alongside broadly defined public
writing spaces.</p>

<h3>Chōra: Bodies, Minds, and (Disney) World</h3>

<p>The study of rhetoric and composition has entered its space age. An intense
subset of the field seeks the where of writing, what Clément might call the
“locus of control”—how writing and writers shape and are shaped by place.
Previous models of intentional, localized writing subjects fail to account for
complex interactions of writers, technologies, and environs. Discussed by, among
others, Sid Dobrin, Byron Hawk, Gregory Ulmer, and Thomas Rickert, chōra helps
complicate and expand both static maps of writing as well as fixed notions of
place. As Rickert explains, “Plato’s chōra is an ancient attempt to think the
relation between matter and activity, work and space, background and meaning”
(Ambient Rhetoric 42). Applied to writing, chōra indicates the impossibly
complex relational networks which surround and bind the writing subject. To
“theorize subjectivity ambiently,” as Rickert suggests, abandons the search for
loci of control and leaves writing studies with a necessarily ethereal
metaphor.</p>

<p>Ambience informs this project’s critical approach to tourism. To contrast
with prior hermeneutic readings of Disney World, Death Tour should be viewed “in
terms of embedded and embodied immersion rather than connection, dispersed and
interactive flow rather than node, conditions of possibility rather than static
presence” (92). In relation to the tourist subject, chōric place cannot be
pinpointed on the map, but rather witnessed as an “affective, circulating, and
evolving series of encounters” (44). Disney’s Magic Kingdom sits at 28.417663°N
latitude, 81.581212°W longitude, but its sense of place is determined by how
people “come together in the continual making of a place; at the same time, that
place is interwoven into the way they have come to be as they are” (xiii).</p>

<p>Further examined in a later section, articulation promisingly accounts for
rhetorical co-determinacy between human and non-human agents. Whereas the
ethereal metaphor ambience suggests no immediate pedagogy, articulation makes
visible a composition practice which leaves open the possibility of alternative
writings. By engaging with Disney World—its symbols, lore, spatial arrangements,
and even the absent presence of death—the tourist and the tour articulate space
in Jacob W. Greene’s sense: “when a writer ‘articulates’ a location, she
discovers and creates relationships between the human and non-human entities
already circulating within it as potential rhetorical actors” (2017). The tour
(re)considers Disney World a place which obscures the fatal consequences of its
very existence, but site-specific death markers only partially fulfill Death
Tour’s intended use as “a responsive way of revealing the world for others,
responding to and put forth through affective, symbolic, and material means”
(162). The ambient thanatourist responds to space according to personal
histories, desires, sensations, etc., and space in turn alters the tourist’s
affective makeup. Thus, a map marker merely suggests points of disclosure in the
ambient sense: “itself manifold and ambient; it can be performed, practiced, and
activated in many ways, only so much of which will at any given time be directly
appropriable to consciousness, intention, or theorization” (72). Each encounter
with a Hidden Mortimer has the potential to alter the thanatourist by exposing
her to a previously undisclosed point of articulation. That point, however, does
not determine a particular vector, making it impossible to project this tour’s
intentional impact. Instead, thanatourism encourages articulation of space as a
“process of creating temporary, contingent connections [...] through which
familiar ideas begin to emerge as something new” (Greene 2017), yet never
insists upon narrative supremacy.</p>

<p>In contrast to David Foster Wallace’s luxury cruise, critical thanatourism
adopts William Bartram as a kind of Floridian proto-tourist. Discussed by
Madison Jones in his 2017 Association for the Study of Literature and
Environment (ASLE) presentation, Bartram paddled Florida’s Silver Springs and
wrote from his canoe’s emplaced vantage point, attuned to the unmediated
materiality of the Springs. The “emplaced composition” Jones develops from
Bartram’s example rescues material specificity from culturally mediated
abstraction. Toward a fuller articulation of place, this mapping reintroduces
specific loss, marking sites of nature’s most inescapable collisions with
culture. Disney Death Tour negotiates a rhetoricity of tourism that is always
already thanatourism.</p>
