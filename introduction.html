<h3>The Mouse and the Myth</h3>

<p>Did you know? “It’s company policy... [N]o one dies at Disney” (<em>Inside
the Mouse</em> 115). Depending on the source, when a tourist with a heart
condition goes lifeless on a roller coaster, medical
professionals by decree must wait to make the death pronouncement off-property.
Such a claim suggests corporate mediation so concentrated as to censor death
itself. Whether or not it can be verified through documentary evidence, in its
own way this “Disney death myth” characterizes power relations to the Walt
Disney Company and lends to its Orlando theme parks a sense of place.</p>

<p>Called a “Vatican with mouse ears” (qtd. in Clément 6), Disney holds
tremendous influence in Florida, where it employs more people than any other
company in the state, upwards of 56,000.  Local <a href="http://goo.gl/GhCFJY">policy</a>
often reflects Disney “flexing its bicep,” as one state senator put it. In 1967,
Florida’s House granted unrivaled autonomy to the company: a private charter
allows Disney to operate its parks independent of “state and county regulation
of buildings, land use, airport and nuclear power plant construction, and even
the distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages” (Foglesong 71). With its
propensity for shaping elections and securing favorable legal conditions, it might not
be so absurd to imagine Disney flexing its muscles to outlaw death too.</p>

<p>Of course, people do <a href="http://goo.gl/M8EfkP">die</a> at Disney World.
Most result from pre-existing conditions, some from accidents. Some result from
a horrifying collision of natural and built worlds: In 2016, two
year-old Lane Graves was  <a href="http://goo.gl/KmCcKQ">killed</a> by an alligator at
Disney's Grand Floridian Resort and Spa. Florida theme parks report injuries and
deaths to the state Department of Agriculture, and Disney has had to pay fines
issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) for safety
violations. Disney, however, has to obligation to publicize the deaths it cannot
control. But with the advent of mobile computing technologies, this project,
“Disney Death Tour,” reintroduces obscured narratives into restricted
write-space.</p>

<p>Disney Death Tour commemorates those who have died at Walt Disney World. It
puts commercial tourism in conversation with critical spatial theory. As writing
studies enters its space age, Disney theme parks become sites where writing
technologies bring new civic potentials into focus. Structured as a guided tour,
Death Tour redirects the flow of foot traffic and installs an alternative
writing of theme park space. At the same time, it avoids above all else the
supremacy of any narrative; this is a writing, but neither Death Tour nor the
Disney Company can claim unilateral authority. Instead what this project makes
clear is the continual structuring and restructuring of space determined by its
participants.</p>

<p>Gregory L. Ulmer's “MEmorial” genre offers a means of recognizing and
writing communal attitudes towards tragedy. Whereas traditional monuments
enshrine only official values, the MEmorial operates as an internet monument
that facilitates civic practices for rewriting public space. MEmorials bridge the
psychic distance between catastrophe and complacency by constructing a visceral
reminder of abject social sacrifices, in this case in the tourist industry: At
Disney World, you walk among the dead.</p>

<p>The tour starts with a single tragedy:</p>

<p><blockquote>“Raymond Barlow, 65, was on a platform for the Skyway in
Fantasyland when the cable-car ride was switched on for the park's opening,
sending one of the gondolas toward the part-time worker. The startled Clermont
resident grabbed the four-person gondola and struggled to pull himself inside,
park employees told investigators. On the way up, he apparently was looking for
a place to land and let go over a flower bed, snapping some tree branches on the
way down, the workers said.” (<em>Orlando Sentinel</em>, “Worker At Disney
Plunges To His Death”)</blockquote></p>

<p>Although the Skyway was torn down six months later, and Disney was fined
$4,500 for “a ‘serious’ violation of safety standards,” the <em>Sentinel</em>
reported that “The ride's closing is not a result of any concerns about its
safety.” As one commenter suggested, "Disney figured it could make better use of
the space.” At the time of this writing, the Magic Kingdom features no marker or
plaque memorializing Barlow’s fall, even though his sacrifice helps maintain
Disney World and, at a different scale, the tourist industry in general. Disney
Death Tour makes use of the space to better recognize similar abject losses.</p>

<p>Barlow’s fall encapsulates some of Death Tour’s priorities. Power mediates
space both physically, as in tearing down a ride, as well as through discursive
construction. Conversely, as Sid Dobrin writes, “though one body orders a space
to a particular end, that order is not necessarily recognized or obeyed by all
who enter that space” (40). Corporations have images to maintain, which for
Disney means preserving its status as the happiest place on earth. Space is
carefully arranged to suppress or containerize the abject. Like a designated
smoking section, Disney has the Haunted Mansion for death, where haunting
follows a script. In Barlow’s case, the official story dismisses any link
between safety concerns and the decision to close the Skyway, but the claims of
the powerful cannot assuage the death myth’s subversive appeal. Locative
computing technologies like augmented reality and this tour’s phone app permit
unsanctioned narratives into hypermediated corporate spaces.</p>

<p>Disney scrutinizes what enters and leaves its property such that
truth seems to circulate only in the off-record whispers of its employees:</p>

<p><blockquote>We had a guy last summer who went to EPCOT, stood under the golf
ball, took a gun, and blew his head off. But he didn’t die. He stood right there
in front of all those tourists and went “cluck” and brains blew everywhere. But
he didn’t die there. The medic told me that they are not allowed to let them die
there. Keep them alive by artificial means until they’re off Disney property,
like there’s an imaginary line in the road and they go, “He’s alive, he’s alive,
he’s dead.” (qtd. in <em>Inside the Mouse</em> 115)</blockquote></p>

<p>But Death Tour is premised on an urban legend. If veracity were the only metric for
a narrative’s value, this one hardly satisfies.  Online fact-checker <em><a href="http://goo.gl/AhVQBT">Snopes</a></em>
examines the claim, “Disney can legitmately [sic] claim that no one has ever
died at one of their theme parks, because they always ensure that accident
victims are removed from park property before being declared dead.” Though it
renders a “false” verdict, <em>Snopes</em> acknowledges “This legend is a tricky
subject to tackle, because it’s based upon the fine (and often confusing)
distinction between actual death and declared death.” Actual death becomes
declared death through an act of writing. Literate practices structure life and
death through writing. A birth certificate declares “this person is,” and a
gravemarker “this person was.”  The death myth suggests the believable (to the
extent that any legend is believable) potential of Disney to interrupt death
through writing. To clarify, Death Tour does not literally (or literately)
accept the death myth as law of the land. It instead explores how Disney deaths
circulate in a network of lore, industry, politics, place, and community
discourse.</p>

<p>Despite all efforts to control a corporate image, whether sinister or
practical, no imagineer can stop people from dying at Disney. In addition to
Barlow, around 30 people have died at Disney theme parks since 1977 (an exact
figure is difficult to cobble together). Most were the result of preexisting
conditions or natural causes, what one report calls “not surprising.” Some were
freak accidents. In many cases, families pursued legal action and reached
financial settlements with the Disney Company.</p>

<p>Death is downplayed but not denied outright. Under less litigious
circumstances, Disney World works with the Make-A-Wish foundation, offering some
source of comfort for terminally ill children and their families. And in a
gesture toward what Death Tour aims to further articulate, Disney <a href="http://goo.gl/WC6wDe">erected</a>
a lighthouse statue in memory of Lane Graves near the site of his death. Make no mistake, this is a complicated
and extremely sad matter. Unlike other paranoid conspiracy theories and academic
critiques aimed at Disney's aesthetic formations, we are operating to
acknowledge these disasters in a serious and respectful way.</p>

<h3>Criticizing the Mouse</h3>

<p>Critical approaches to Disney theme parks are nothing new. In 1995, the
cultural studies ensemble The Project on Disney published <em>Inside the Mouse:
Work and Play at Disney World</em>, which conducts a critical examination of and
in Disney theme parks. In part the book is a model—it weighs the cognitive dissonance
of critics-turned-tourists (“The Problem with Pleasure”),
suggests playfully subversive negotiations of park space (“The Alternative
Ride”), and can’t resist a degree of anti-authority snark (“Working at the
Rat”). It also helps circulate the “no one dies at Disney” legend as a
counter-narrative which escapes corporate oversight. The Project on Disney
serves as a precedent, a source for the myth, and ultimately a point of
departure for the Disney Death Tour.</p>

<p>Thibaut Clément’s excellent review of literature, “‘Locus of Control:’ a
Selective Review of Disney Theme Parks,” traces this suspicion of intellectual
work toward mass entertainment. Efforts to identify the “locus of control” in
Disney’s parks traversed the high-brow/low-brow debates of the last century.
Critical hostility emerges as early as 1958, when screenwriter Julian Halevy
remarked, “[Disney parks] exist for the relief of tension and boredom, as
tranquilizers for social anxiety” (qtd. in Clément 1). Other voices saw in
Disneyland a restoration of the public sphere, of performance and participation.
Recent work finds the productive rather than pessimistic possibilities in
commercial tourist spaces. As opposed to an early postmodern view of Disney
parks as “sets of signs and representations arranged into a discourse and
intended to blur the distinction between reality and fantasy,” Clément
argues:</p>

<p><blockquote>In assigning various degrees of agency to the parks’
participants, critics have gradually displaced the locus of control for the
parks’ meaning, design, and operations from the Disney corporation to the
individual user and the company’s socio-economic context, paying increasing
attention to the audience’s interpretive activity and the parks’ competitive
environment. (8)</blockquote></p>

<p>He concludes, “Visitors are not ‘cultural dopes’ but rather actively
reconstruct available meanings to elaborate strategies and pursue motives of
their own” (8). Seeking the locus of control shifts from identifying the
presence of agency to the more nuanced assessment of “how much credit the parks’
various participants must be given in shaping and assigning meaning to the
parks’ environment” (9). Disney Death Tour extends “interpretive activity,”
actually reinscribing the space. Assigning “credit,” however, means thinking of
writing and writing subjects participating in complex, networked ecologies. As
this project goes on to explore, a locus of control cannot be neatly accounted
for because writing theory confounds the locus of subjectivity.</p>

<p>Including this selection of previous scholarship clarifies Disney Death Tour’s
intentions—what it is, and what it is not. Not an exposé revealing
corporate secrets, nor a critically aloof reading of Disney parks. Neither does
it state the obvious: of course visitors cultivate personal meanings in even the
most mediated of public spaces. Whereas previous critical work formulates Disney
parks in terms of either the passive reception of signs or the active
construction of individual interpretations, of dominant ideologies or subversive
subjectivities, Death Tour introduces new writings into the space itself. At the
same time, it is an exploration spatial writing theories. Death Tour employs as
much its methods–MEmorality, psychogeography, augmented reality, critical
tourism–as an inquiry into the limits of those methods.</p>
