<h3>The Mouse and the Myth</h3>

<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> “It’s company policy... [N]o one dies at
Disney” (Inside the Mouse 115). Depending on the source, when a tourist with a
heart condition goes lifeless on a roller coaster, medical professionals by
decree must wait to make the death pronouncement off-property. Such a claim
suggests corporate mediation so concentrated as to censor death itself. Whether
or not it can be verified through documentary evidence, in its own way this
“Disney death myth” characterizes power relations to the Walt Disney Company and
lends to its Orlando theme parks a sense of place.</p>

<p>Called a “Vatican with mouse ears” (qtd. in Clément 6), Disney holds
tremendous influence in Florida, where it employs more people than any other
company in the state, upwards of 56,000. Local policy often reflects Disney
“flexing its bicep,” as one state senator put it. In 1967, Florida’s House
granted unrivaled autonomy to the company in the form of a private charter,
which allows Disney to operate its parks independent of “state and county
regulation of buildings, land use, airport and nuclear power plant construction,
and even the distribution and sale of alcoholic beverages” (Foglesong 71). With
its propensity for shaping elections and securing favorable legal conditions, it
might not be so absurd to imagine Disney flexing its muscles to outlaw death
too.</p>

<p>Of course, people often do die at Walt Disney World. While, most result from
pre-existing conditions, many are the result of accidents on rides or negligence
by the park. Some result from a horrifying collision of natural and built
worlds, like in 2016, when two year-old Lane Graves was killed by an alligator
at Disney’s Grand Floridian Resort and Spa. All Florida theme parks are required
to report injuries and deaths to the state Department of Agriculture, and Disney
has had to pay regular fines issued by the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) for safety violations. Disney, however, has no obligation
to publicize these deaths, and despite the Orlando park itself being constructed
as a memorial to Walt’s death, Disney has constructed no such accompanying
monuments within the park to memorialize the numerous deaths of workers and
visitors that occur within that space. But with the use of mobile computing
technologies, our “Disney Death Tour,” offers a means of reintroducing these
marginalized narratives back into this restricted write-space, creating the
opportunity for users to rewrite their sensory experience of the park to include
collective mourning.</p>

<p>Disney Death Tour commemorates those who have died at Walt Disney World. It
puts commercial tourism in conversation with critical spatial theory. As
multimodal composition practices put writing studies into new negotiations with
space, Disney theme parks can become sites where writing technologies bring new
civic potentials into focus. Structured as a guided tour, the Death Tour
redirects the flow of foot traffic and installs an alternative writing of theme
park space that mirrors Jeff Rice’s use of digital logics to renegotiate
traditionally-conceived physical spaces in Digital Detroit. At the same time, it
challenges above all else the supremacy of any narrative; this is a writing, but
neither the Death Tour nor the Disney Company can claim unilateral authority.
Instead what this project makes clear is the continual structuring and
restructuring of space determined by its participants as made possible through
ubiquitous mobile computing technologies.</p>

<p>Gregory L. Ulmer’s concept of the “MEmorial” offers a means of recognizing
and writing communal attitudes towards tragedy. Whereas traditional monuments
enshrine only official values, the MEmorial operates as an internet monument
that facilitates civic practices for rewriting public space. MEmorials bridge
the psychic distance between catastrophe and complacency by constructing a
visceral reminder of abject social sacrifices, in this case in the tourist
industry—at Disney World, you walk among the dead.</p>

<p>Spatially, the tour can be experienced in any order, but temporally, it
begins with a single tragedy:</p>

<p><blockquote>“Raymond Barlow, 65, was on a platform for the Skyway in
Fantasyland when the cable-car ride was switched on for the park's opening,
sending one of the gondolas toward the part-time worker. The startled Clermont
resident grabbed the four-person gondola and struggled to pull himself inside,
park employees told investigators. On the way up, he apparently was looking for
a place to land and let go over a flower bed, snapping some tree branches on the
way down, the workers said.”  (Orlando Sentinel, “Worker At Disney Plunges To
His Death”)</blockquote></p>

<p>Although the Skyway was torn down six months later, and Disney was fined
$4,500 for “a ‘serious’ violation of safety standards,” the Sentinel reported
that “The ride's closing is not a result of any concerns about its safety.” As
one commenter suggested, “Disney figured it could make better use of the space.”
At the time of this writing, the Magic Kingdom features no marker or plaque
memorializing Barlow’s fall, even though his sacrifice helps maintain Disney
World and, at a different scale, the tourist industry in general. Disney Death
Tour makes use of the space to better recognize similar abject losses.</p>

<p>Barlow’s fall, and Disney’s subsequent response, encapsulate some of the key
spatial principles that the Death Tour explores. Power mediates space both
physically, as in tearing down a ride, as well as through discursive
construction. Conversely, as Sid Dobrin writes, “though one body orders a space
to a particular end, that order is not necessarily recognized or obeyed by all
who enter that space” (40). When entering a Disney park, space is ordered, but
not necessarily obeyed, as the Death Tour provides an alternative option for
occupying the park. Corporations have images to maintain, which for Disney means
preserving its parks’ status as the happiest, most magical places on earth.
Space is carefully arranged to suppress or containerize contradictory
narratives, in this case the deaths of parkgoers and workers. Like a designated
smoking section, Disney confines death to the Haunted Mansion, where the
afterlife follows a safe, playful script. In Barlow’s case, the official story
dismisses any link between safety concerns and the decision to close the Skyway,
but the claims of those constructing the narrative cannot assuage the death
myth’s subversive appeal. Without taking this myth’s appeal as factual truth,
our Death Tour operates according to its same subversive logic. As such, we use
locative computing technologies, like the augmented reality used in this tour’s
phone app, to permit unsanctioned narratives into these hypermediated corporate
spaces.</p>

<p>Disney scrutinizes what enters and leaves its property such that truth seems
only to circulate in the off-record whispers of its employees:</p>

<p><blockquote>We had a guy last summer who went to EPCOT, stood under the golf
ball, took a gun, and blew his head off. But he didn’t die. He stood right there
in front of all those tourists and went “cluck” and brains blew everywhere. But
he didn’t die there. The medic told me that they are not allowed to let them die
there. Keep them alive by artificial means until they’re off Disney property,
like there’s an imaginary line in the road and they go, “He’s alive, he’s alive,
he’s dead.” (Qtd. in Inside the Mouse 115)</blockquote></p>

<p>Death Tour is premised on an urban legend. If veracity were the only metric
for a narrative’s value, this one hardly satisfies. Online fact-checker Snopes
examines the claim, “Disney can legitmately [sic] claim that no one has ever
died at one of their theme parks, because they always ensure that accident
victims are removed from park property before being declared dead.” Though it
renders a “false” verdict, Snopes acknowledges “This legend is a tricky subject
to tackle, because it’s based upon the fine (and often confusing) distinction
between actual death and declared death.” Actual death becomes declared death
through an act of writing. Literate practices structure life and death through
writing: a birth certificate declares “this person is,” and a gravemarker “this
person was.” The death myth suggests the believable (to the extent that any
legend is believable) potential of Disney to interrupt death through writing. To
clarify, Death Tour does not literally (or literately) accept the death myth as
law of the land. It instead explores how Disney deaths circulate in a network of
lore, industry, politics, and place-making.

<p>Despite all efforts to control a corporate image, whether sinister or
practical, no imagineer can stop people from dying at Disney. In addition to
Barlow, over 30 people have died at Disney theme parks since 1977 (although an
exact figure is difficult to cobble together). Most were the result of
preexisting conditions or natural causes, what one report calls “not
surprising.” Some were freak accidents. In many cases, families pursued legal
action and reached financial settlements with the Disney Company.</p>

<p>Death is downplayed but not denied outright. Under less litigious
circumstances, Disney World works with the Make-A-Wish foundation, offering some
source of comfort for terminally ill children and their families. And in a
gesture toward what Death Tour aims to further articulate, Disney erected a
lighthouse statue in memory of Lane Graves near the site of his death. Make no
mistake, this is a complicated and extremely sad matter. Unlike other paranoid
conspiracy theories and academic critiques aimed at Disney’s aesthetic
formations, we are operating to acknowledge these disasters in a serious and
respectful way.</p>

<h3>Criticizing the Mouse</h3>

<section class="epigraph">
<p>“[A] subversive triumph at unearthing such slag so near to Disney’s golden portals.”
<br>—Carl Hiassen, Team Rodent</p>
</section>

<p>Critical approaches to Disney theme parks are nothing new. In 1995, the
cultural studies ensemble The Project on Disney published Inside the Mouse: Work
and Play at Disney World, which conducts an examination of and in Disney theme
parks. In part the book is a model—it weighs the cognitive dissonance of
critics-turned-tourists (“The Problem with Pleasure”), suggests playfully
subversive negotiations of park space (“The Alternative Ride”), and of course
can’t resist a degree of anti-authority snark (“Working at the Rat”). It also
helps circulate the “no one dies at Disney” legend as a counter-narrative that
escapes corporate oversight. The Project on Disney serves as a precedent, a
source for the myth, and ultimately a point of departure for the Disney Death
Tour. Whereas these critical approaches to Disney offer readings, hermeneutics
for the park’s arrangement and the company’s actions, our approach enacts a
writing.</p>

<p>Thibaut Clément’s excellent review of literature, “‘Locus of Control:’ a
Selective Review of Disney Theme Parks,” traces this intellectual suspicion
toward mass entertainment. Efforts to identify the “locus of control”—the where
of meaning-making—in Disney’s parks traversed the high-brow/low-brow debates of
the last century. Critical hostility emerges as early as 1958, when screenwriter
Julian Halevy remarked, “[Disney parks] exist for the relief of tension and
boredom, as tranquilizers for social anxiety” (qtd. in Clément 1). Other voices
saw in Disneyland a restoration of the public sphere, of performance and
participation. Recent work finds the productive rather than pessimistic
possibilities in commercial tourist spaces. As opposed to an early postmodern
view of Disney parks as “sets of signs and representations arranged into a
discourse and intended to blur the distinction between reality and fantasy,”
Clément argues:</p>

<p><blockquote>In assigning various degrees of agency to the parks’
participants, critics have gradually displaced the locus of control for the
parks’ meaning, design, and operations from the Disney corporation to the
individual user and the company’s socio-economic context, paying increasing
attention to the audience’s interpretive activity and the parks’ competitive
environment. (8)</blockquote></p>

<p>He concludes, “Visitors are not ‘cultural dopes’ but rather actively
reconstruct available meanings to elaborate strategies and pursue motives of
their own” (8). Seeking the locus of control shifts from identifying the
presence of agency to the more nuanced assessment of “how much credit the parks’
various participants must be given in shaping and assigning meaning to the
parks’ environment” (9). Disney Death Tour extends “interpretive activity” by
reinscribing the space through digital writing implements. Assigning “credit,”
however, means thinking of writing and writing subjects participating in
complex, networked ecologies. As this project goes on to explore, and as
MEmorials help visualize, a locus of control cannot be neatly accounted for
because writing theory confounds the locus of subjectivity itself.</p>

<p>Including this selection of previous scholarship clarifies Disney Death
Tour’s intentions—what it is, and what it is not. Not an exposé revealing
corporate secrets, nor a critically aloof reading of Disney parks. Neither does
it state the obvious: of course visitors cultivate personal meanings in even the
most mediated of public spaces. Whereas this previous critical work formulates
Disney parks in terms of either the passive reception of signs or the active
construction of individual interpretations, of dominant ideologies or subversive
subjectivities, the Death Tour introduces new writings into the space itself. At
the same time, it is an exploratory spatial writing theory. Death Tour employs
as much its methods–MEmorality, psychogeography, augmented reality, critical
tourism–as an inquiry into the limits of those methods.</p>
